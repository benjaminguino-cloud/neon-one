<![CDATA[<p>Beth Stokes, executive director of Episcopal Community Services San Francisco, worries the order threatens to undo decades of progress in the movement to end homelessness.</p>



<p>“We are deeply troubled by the administration’s executive order, which abandons compassionate and evidence-based programs, like <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/harm-reduction">harm reduction</a> and <a href="https://homelessness.ucsf.edu/blog/housing-first-not-housing-only">housing first</a>, and replaces them with cruel policies such as forced treatment and criminalizing poor people for being unhoused,” she said in a statement. “Instead of investing in solutions we know work, this policy punishes people for the system’s failures.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Beth Stokes — executive director of the San Francisco-based shelter-and-services provider Episcopal Community Services — said she hopes at least some of those vouchers might be used to address another choke point in The City’s shelter and supportive-housing system.</p>



<p>Stokes told The Examiner that too often, the system — which generally prioritizes those with the highest needs, including those with medical or mental health challenges as well as those who have been on the street the longest — has neglected many relatively well-off people.</p>



<p>“Once we meet that person who comes into shelter, they might say, ‘Hey, I have a full time job. I’m making $1,500 a month,’” [ECS Executive Director Beth Stokes] said. “That’s a perfect person to get out of the system really quickly,” with even a modest amount of support such as, for example, an emergency housing voucher.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Today the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-homelessness.html">issued a ruling</a> that will have lasting impacts on our country’s homelessness crisis. The decision in the case of Johnson v. Grants Pass has effectively legitimized the criminalization of homelessness, thus punishing people for experiencing the most extreme levels of poverty. Episcopal Community Services (ECS) has advocated against this approach from the start; signing on to an <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/homeless-advocates-pen-supreme-court-brief-19381821.php">amicus brief</a> in opposition to this unjust and cruel policy. As both the Executive Director of ECS, and a human being, I am appalled and deeply disheartened by this decision.</p>



<p>Let me be clear, homelessness is not a choice. The causes of homelessness are complex and often rooted in insurmountable hardship due to systemic racism, exorbitant cost of housing, and economic inequality. Homelessness is the most extreme manifestation of poverty in American society; the experience of being unhoused is traumatic enough without being punished and criminalized with fines or incarceration for simply having nowhere safe to sleep. Furthermore, people experiencing homelessness endure significant negative impacts on their health and wellbeing. Despite knowing this, our society continues to demonize and stigmatize those we should be treating with compassionate care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>This is unacceptable.</strong>
</p>



<p>Our fundamental approach to service is centered around proven strategies that address homelessness holistically by providing long-term affordable housing options, paired with the wraparound supportive services which empower our participants with the resources and tools they need to end their homelessness, meet their goals, and transform their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s decision undoubtedly marks a dark moment in our nation’s history, but we cannot let adversity set us back. ECS will continue to staunchly advocate for our unhoused neighbors and prioritize approaches which center humanity, dignity, and empathy.</p>



<p>In solidarity,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“If we want to get serious about overdose prevention, we have to say the quiet part out loud: the vast majority of overdoses and overdose deaths take place inside people’s homes,” write ECS Executive Director Beth Stokes and HealthRight360 President and CEO Vitka Eisen in an op-ed for the San Francisco Examiner addressing the tragedy of rising overdose deaths. Our two community-based organizations point to proven, evidence-based strategies that are needed to put people on the path to drug recovery: universal access to Narcan (naxalone) for supportive housing sites and training to administer it for staff, residents, and peers, overdose prevention rooms within supportive housing, support for people who want to live in a drug-free environment, and properly funded, right-sized contracts enabling providers to bring critical behavioral health care resources to bear.”</p>

Developed by Mercy Housing California and Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco (ECS), it features 256 affordable homes in a service-enriched environment, with residents having access to on-site clinical, case management, and in-home care services.</p>



<p>“What makes 1064 Mission Street so unique is the unprecedented level of partnership between government at the federal, state, and local levels, nonprofits, and the community in its acquisition, development, and operations,” says ECS executive director Beth Stokes. “… We hope that this innovative service model can be replicated throughout other projects across the United States.””</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“Today we issue a challenge to ourselves, our peers, and our community. We can create temporary and long-term housing that is human-centric. We can reduce the capacity of large scale shelters to provide a greater degree of more qualitative and individualized service, while simultaneously exploring creative mechanisms to site and fund new facilities within our community. We must ensure that the hard lessons we learn today are not learned in vain, so that our neighbors living on the street, in our shelters, and those fortunate enough to be placed in hotels, have access to the same level of safety and security going forward that much of the rest of us take for granted. Simply put, we can and we must do better.”</p>

<p>Timothy Isaiah experienced homelessness for over 30 years before moving into his new home at 833 Bryant St in November 2021. Timothy is one of 145 formerly homeless tenants that now live in this permanent supportive housing (PSH) site, accompanied by ECS wrap-around service. The units at 833 Bryant, which cost just $385,000 per unit compared to the standard cost of over $600,000 per unit, set an example that when innovation and commitment come together, we can solve one of the most difficult challenges our city faces.</p>

<p>ECS is proud to be a part of a first-of-its kind program in California launched in San Francisco to bring supportive services directly to the homes of formerly homeless San Franciscans. While In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) – as these services are known – has been an integral part of the social services fabric in California for a while, bringing it to residents of permanent supportive housing in a systematic and intentional way is new.</p>



<p>The San Francisco Chronicle reports on the project, noting that city officials believe that the success of strategy will greatly reduce social service costs for the taxpayer and improve health outcomes for supportive housing residents who would most benefit. The Chronicle notes the pilot of this project happening at the Minna Lee, where ECS provides supportive services for some 50 residents. The in-home visits are being conducted by Homebridge, a community partner.</p>

<p>Shireen McSpadden took the helm last month as the director of San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. McSpadden is coming to the department at a pivotal time. At last count, the city had more than&nbsp;<a href="https://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019HIRDReport_SanFrancisco_FinalDraft-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8,000 people</a>&nbsp;experiencing homelessness, and experts have predicted that number could grow as a result of pandemic-related job losses.</p>



<p>She’s overseeing a department with a budget that’s grown more than 60% to nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HSH-FY21-23-Budget-Deck_LHCB_6.7.2021_corrected.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$672 million</a>. The dramatic increase is a result of newly released funding from Proposition C, a tax on corporate revenues that voters approved in 2018, to fund new housing and services for people experiencing homelessness.</p>



<p>The former executive director of the Department of Disability and Aging Services, McSpadden takes over from Abigail Stewart-Kahn, who served as interim director of the department during the pandemic after former Director Jeff Kositsky stepped down.</p>



<p>On Thursday, McSpadden toured one of San Francisco’s newest permanent supportive housing sites, the Post Hotel, operated by Episcopal Community Services and Caritas Management Corporation. The converted hotel will provide housing for 89 adults and couples, including 18 existing tenants. Residents will pay no more than 30% of their income toward rent.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Want to solve America’s urban homeless crisis? First, you have to believe it can be fixed. Anyone who has passed by the seemingly endless rows of hard-worn tents and makeshift shelters scattered under San Francisco’s bridges, beside its freeways, and along its sidewalks has probably struggled to imagine how our nation’s homeless crisis might be solved. </p>



<p>In San Francisco, an estimated 8,000 men, women, and children lack a stable home at any one time. About 2,800 experience chronic, long-term homelessness. And in a city where the cost of living is vastly higher than the national average, a single unit of “supportive” housing — a safe, comfortable place to live accompanied by counseling and other services — can take up to six years to complete and cost taxpayers and/or charities upwards of $600,000.</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mag-housing-inset2.jpeg">



<p>When it’s finished, the six-story building at 833 Bryant Street (shown here in an artist’s rendering) will be San Francisco’s first 100% affordable modular housing project. </p>

<p>For homeless people, a place to live is life changing to a degree that almost no other intervention can provide. </p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO — The inside of the van was lined with plastic. The driver was masked and ready to go. There was a seat for just one passenger.</p>



<p>Gregory Sanchez eyed the setup warily. Mr. Sanchez was 64 and homeless, and the van was there to ferry him from a sidewalk tent to a room where he could shelter from the pandemic. It was good news,&nbsp;<em>blessed</em>&nbsp;news, he said. It was also a little creepy.</p>



<p>Mr. Sanchez didn’t know where he was going, and the sheets of foggy plastic, which coated the seats and windows to prevent the spread of disease, made it impossible to see out the window. Riding away from his longtime home in San Francisco’s Mission District, he cycled through dark possibilities — “It felt like I was in one of those movies where they take you to an army base or something” — before the door opened in front of a boutique hotel. He stepped down from the van and walked to a curved granite reception desk where he set a bin of clothes on a luggage cart.</p>



<p>“I go like, ‘Is this real? Can this be real?’” he said. “And they take me to the room, and the room is beautiful.”</p>

 <em>Watch a video celebrating the San Francisco Interfaith Winter Shelter’s&nbsp;30th year&nbsp;in 2018.</em>



<p>The low temperatures and wet weather of San Francisco’s winter months are dangerous for people experiencing homelessness, and particularly those who are unsheltered and vulnerable to exposure-related illnesses. Starting on November 24, 2019, Episcopal Community Services (ECS), in collaboration with partners the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sfinterfaithcouncil.org/" target="_blank">San Francisco Interfaith Council</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://hsh.sfgov.org/" target="_blank">Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing</a>, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sfnightministry.org/" target="_blank">San Francisco Night Ministry</a>&nbsp;will once again launch the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program. The shelter will be hosted by the congregations of the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption, St. Mark’s Lutheran Church, First Unitarian Universalist Society, and by ECS at the Canon Kip Senior Center.</p>



<p>Now in its 31st year, the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program provides a low-barrier overnight shelter for up to 100 men experiencing homelessness, as well as dinner and breakfast cooked and served by more than 50 volunteer groups. This year, the shelter will be open from November 24, 2019 until March 28, 2020.&nbsp;While staying at the shelter, guests will have the option to engage with members of the San Francisco Night Ministry,&nbsp;who will be&nbsp;onsite to offer chaplaincy services, as well as <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/ecs-problem-solvers-finding-creative-personalized-solutions-to-homelessness/">ECS Problem Solvers</a>, who take an innovative, highly personalized approach to help people experiencing homelessness find creative solutions and pathways to housing.</p>



<span id="more-4849">
</span>



<p>
<em>During the winter, shelter is crucial to prevent life-threatening conditions like hypothermia caused by exposure to cold weather and rain.</em>
</p>



<p>“The Interfaith Winter Shelter Program plays an important role in providing shelter for our chronically homeless neighbors during the winter months, and ECS is proud to continue to offer our operational expertise to support it,” says ECS Executive Director Beth Stokes. “Engaging with guests at the Winter Shelter is a key first step to bringing individuals experiencing homelessness inside, off the streets, and near the critical health services they need to stabilize and move into permanent housing.”</p>



<p>ECS is grateful for the indispensable partnership provided by the San Francisco Interfaith Council (which works to identify the host churches where the overnight shelter is located and to identify the church groups, congregations and community groups that sign up to provide the evening meals throughout the program), the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, and the faith communities and volunteers who make the Interfaith Winter Shelter possible every year.</p>

<p>ECS has long been one of San Francisco’s leading providers of interim and supportive housing and other services for seniors who are low-income and/or homeless (currently or formerly). In fact, this group comprises roughly one‐third of residents at ECS shelters and supportive housing sites. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://t3472744.icpro.co/track.aspx?id=460|34FD68|5028|3748|FD|0|3BE|1|29EE8711&amp;destination=https%3a%2f%2fecs-sf.org%2fcanon-kip-senior-center%2f&amp;dchk=3A32367A" target="_blank">Canon Kip Senior Center</a>&nbsp;serves more than 1,400 seniors annually, providing a vital hub of daytime meals, case management services, and community activities for older adults.</p>



<p>Seniors are the fastest growing demographic among homeless populations—their number is expected to double in major cities over the next decade. That’s one reason why we’re more focused than ever on healthy aging for seniors who are homeless and/or low-income.</p>



<span id="more-4715">

<strong>ECS’s First Director of Healthy Aging</strong>
</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Liz-Tarzon-1.png"> <em>Liz Tarzon, ECS’s Director of Healthy Aging.</em>



<p>To better meet the chronic, high-acuity needs of this growing population, last November ECS hired its first Director of Healthy Aging, Liz Tarzon. In this role, Tarzon oversees the Canon Kip Senior Center and leads the Healthy Aging Program, which is dedicated to finding and implementing better solutions for seniors in ECS programming. Tarzon also continues to lead and expand ECS’s efforts to provide education, training, and public policy advocacy to help seniors age healthily in place.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>Healthy Aging Services</strong>
</p>



<p>In addition to the services provided via the Canon Kip Senior Center, the Healthy Aging Program also extends to ECS’s 15 supportive housing sites, which house over 500 seniors. The program’s focus is to help our residents age in place with a high quality of life by addressing issues such as reduced mobility, dementia, and increased isolation.</p>



<p>One of the Healthy Aging Program’s initiatives has been to
develop trainings for ECS’s non-clinical supportive housing staff to help them deal
with these issues when they see them. The Healthy Aging Program staff also
created a Home Visit Checklist to help identify any dangers in a resident’s
home environment and helps find solutions to help reduce infections, fall
injuries, and depression. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>A New Model of Senior Care in ECS Housing</strong>
</p>



<p>In ECS’s interim housing sites, we are creating a pilot program for a new model of care for seniors in shelters to offer them more specialized services and allow them more time to find ideal solutions for permanent housing. </p>



<p>Through partnerships with the San Francisco Department of Aging and Adult Services, Department of Public Health, and In-Home Supportive Services, these services will include more assistance with medications, a more organized system of personal assistance, and more nutritious meals. In the pilot, the team will capture important, detailed data to share with our partners and help create more effective solutions for seniors experiencing homelessness.</p>

largest supportive housing residence</a> in partnership with Mercy Housing and
the City of San Francisco. Located at 1064 Mission Street (at 7th Street), this
new building will provide 256 supportive housing units for individuals, <strong>104 of which will be exclusively for
seniors</strong>.</p>



<p>These initiatives are just the beginning of our ongoing work to expand and evolve our comprehensive system of care to better meet the unique, growing needs of the increasing senior population in San Francisco, as well as all of our neighbors who might need a helping hand.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Episcopal Community Services (ECS) operates San Francisco’s <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/adult-coordinated-entry/">Adult Coordinated Entry</a> (ACE) system, the gateway for people experiencing homelessness in the city to be matched with the services they need.</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/D3Zy5gjWkAIOwGk.jpg">
<em>Through Adult Coordinated Entry, ECS helps find solutions to homelessness for clients like “Janice,” “Sean,” and their dog Prince.</em>



<p>ECS became the lead agency of ACE for the SF Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing in November 2018. This critical system was designed to provide a clear, standardized, citywide system to assess and prioritize the needs of people living on the streets, as well as a streamlined process to connect them to solutions to help them exit homelessness.</p>



<p>ACE is essential to effectively assessing and identifying the most vulnerable individuals and prioritizing them for solutions at <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/navigation-centers-are-a-key-element-to-ending-homelessness/">Navigation Centers</a>, as well as permanent supportive housing. Since ACE launched in fall of 2018, ECS and its ACE partners have assessed over 6,000 people experiencing homelessness to determine their eligibility for ACE services. The program has helped at least 543 people find housing and another 305 move off the streets and into Navigation Centers. </p>



<span id="more-4607">
</span>



<p>Before ACE was launched, San Francisco didn’t have a comprehensive, easily accessible way for people experiencing homelessness to get the resources they needed. To navigate the system and access the right solutions, clients often needed more help from case managers, or it fell more heavily on clients to perform their own research and advocacy. That can be a challenge for people struggling to meet their basic day-to-day needs ⁠— especially if they have physical or mental health issues.</p>



<p>“The goal of ACE is to make the system more fair, transparent, and equitable for the most vulnerable people,” said Holly Aversano, ECS’s Associate Director of Adult Coordinated Entry.<br>
</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Adult-Coordinated-Entry-Process.png">  <em>This flow chart provides an overview of the Adult Coordinated Entry process.</em>  



<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>Accessing Adult Coordinated Entry</strong>
</p>



<p>People can get registered and assessed for eligibility by ACE staff in a number of ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Office Access Points:</strong> People can walk into one of the two <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/adult-coordinated-entry/">Access Point offices</a> in the Bayview (2111 Jennings St.) and South of Market (123 10th St.) districts.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Mobile Access Points:</strong> People can also request a Mobile Access Point come to them by calling (415) 487-3300 x7000.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>HOT Team:</strong> People may be contacted on the streets by the <a href="https://www.sfhealthnetwork.org/sfhot/">SF Homeless Outreach Team</a>, which reaches out to spread the word about ACE and how to access it. </li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Referrals:</strong> People may be referred to ACE by institutions such as the city’s health system, school district, Human Services Agency, veteran services, or the justice system.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>311:</strong> Anyone can call 3-1-1 to get information on how to access ACE.</li>
</ul>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Carl.jpg">
<em>After living on the streets, ECS’s Problem Solvers helped “Charles” reconnect and move in with a friend in August. He’s stayed positive and focused, and he’s looking forward to stable housing</em>.



<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>Problem Solving and Housing Opportunities</strong>
</p>



<p>Clients who are determined to be eligible are connected with <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/ecs-problem-solvers-finding-creative-personalized-solutions-to-homelessness/">ECS Problem Solvers</a>, who take a highly personalized approach to help people experiencing homelessness find solutions and pathways to housing.</p>



<p>Problem Solvers primarily connect eligible clients with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Conflict Resolution/Mediation:</strong> It isn’t always easy to ask friends and family for a place to stay. When appropriate, Problem Solvers may counsel clients on how to reconnect, build, and mend relationships to help ensure that they and their hosts feel safe and welcome in their new situation.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Financial Assistance:</strong> When designated funds are available, Problem Solvers may help clients cover costs to travel to a new home or provide initial rental costs such as security deposits.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Housing Opportunities:</strong> If a client’s needs meet the criteria to be prioritized for supportive housing, Problem Solvers will help connect them to pathways to those available opportunities. They can also help clients help connect clients to housing outside of the Homelessness Response System.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Education and Job Training:</strong> Clients may also be referred to adult education or job development training programs, such as those included in <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/workforce-development/">ECS’s Workforce Development and Social Enterprise</a> program.</li>
</ul>



<p>For those not eligible, ACE will help connect them to any appropriate resources they might be able to use. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>Housing Assessments and Navigation Services</strong>
</p>



<p>ACE staff uses a 17-item questionnaire to assess whether a person experiencing homelessness will be prioritized for city-funded housing.</p>



<p>Those who are prioritized for city-funded housing as a result of the assessment are offered navigation services. Our “navigators” help clients complete housing applications and connect those sleeping on the streets with a bed in a <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/navigation-centers-are-a-key-element-to-ending-homelessness/">Navigation Center,</a> a temporary housing facility that provides on-site case management, streamlined access to social services and medical care, and assisted entry into pathways to permanent housing. </p>



<p>Clients who move into housing are offered stabilization services, such as medical care or employment support, which help them transition into and maintain their new housing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">
<strong>Our Committed ACE Team</strong>
</p>



<p>One year into the program, our Adult Coordinated Entry team is proud to continue to help lower the barriers to exiting homelessness for more and more people.</p>



<p>As Aversano puts it, “We want to give people as many second chances as possible.”</p>

<p>
<strong>By Josh Steinberger, Associate Manager of Problem Solving </strong>
</p>



<p>Episcopal Community Services’s (ECS) Problem Solvers take an innovative, highly personalized approach to help people experiencing homelessness find creative solutions and pathways to housing. As affordable and supportive housing are available to only a limited number of persons, particularly those with the greatest need, this division of our Adult Coordinated Entry program takes an alternative approach.</p>



<p>Since November 2018 when the program launched, this team of more than a dozen Problem Solvers has worked closely with more than 450 people to provide a fresh look at opportunities in their specific situation to find safe homes. Of the total, 372 people have found housing.</p>



<span id="more-4487">
</span>



<p>Applying their robust experience in working closely with people experiencing poverty and homelessness, Problem Solvers bring a personal touch to reaching out to people experiencing homelessness and helping them discover new ways to clear their hurdles to safe housing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, Problem Solvers may discuss a client’s relationships with friends and family members who might be willing to host them as a guest or roommate. If clients hadn’t seriously considered contacting those potential hosts, Problem Solvers may highlight those opportunities and encourage clients to pursue them. Of course, asking friends and family for help isn’t always easy. So when appropriate, they may also counsel clients on how to reconnect, build, and mend relationships to help ensure that clients and their hosts feel safe and welcome in this new situation.</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ken.jpg"> <em>Ken worked tenaciously with our Problem Solvers to find a home near his work that was within his means. Now that he has stable housing, he can focus fully on his full-time job and health.</em> 



<p>When designated funds are available, Problem Solvers also help clients cover their costs to travel to a new home or provide initial rental costs such as security deposits. For many people experiencing homelessness, those major initial costs present barriers to stable housing that would eliminate high expenses in the short term, such as hotel stays.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, everyone could find secure, affordable housing. But the reality of a dire shortage of local housing and resources to serve people experiencing homelessness often requires outside-of-the-box solutions. Problem Solvers are just one way ECS provides innovative and dynamic services to address the complex nature of homelessness.</p>

<p>Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based practice designed primarily to help people with behavioral health conditions work at regular jobs of their choosing. The model has also evolved to serve others, including transition‐aged youth, veterans, justice‐involved individuals, people receiving public benefits, and, significantly, people experiencing homelessness.</p>



<p>In June, Episcopal Community Services was proud to host a packed discussion on IPS at Google’s office in San Francisco, where nationally recognized experts Rick DeGette and Emery Cowan shared lessons on the process of integrating employment support into homeless systems of care. Speaking to a crowd of homeless service providers from ECS, the City of San Francisco, and other organizations, they reviewed the basic principles of implementing IPS, how those principles have been applied successfully in other counties, states, and organizations, and how this process might be applied for San Francisco’s homeless population.</p>



<span id="more-4412">

<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC_0030.jpg">A crowd of homeless service providers from ECS, the City of San Francisco, and other organizations engaged in the discussion on integrating IPS.



<p>As Rick and Emery explained, studies have shown that in general, 80 percent of people who are homeless want to work. In California, 60-70 percent of those with serious mental illness want jobs, but 90 percent of people who receive public mental health benefits are unemployed. And, as Emery noted, unemployment only exacerbates mental health issues. “We all want to feel like we’re contributing,” she said.</p>



<p>Yet, as crucial as rapid employment is to recovering from homelessness, if people are placed in jobs where they don’t feel comfortable and engaged, they may often lose or leave those jobs quickly. As Rick stressed, “Job matching is everything.”</p>



<p>This learning event was the first step in ECS’s plan to incorporate employment placement into our service model. Already, we have our CHEFS culinary training program, and more recently we launched a partnership with Goodwill for job placement services for individuals who are interviewed in Coordinated Entry. In the following months, we will continue to incorporate IPS principles and activities into all areas of our programming.</p>



<p>So, how do we effectively match individuals facing homelessness and other challenges with the right jobs? The IPS model of practice is designed to do that using eight principles:</p>



<p>
<strong>8 Principles of Individual Placement and Support</strong>
</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Competitive Employment:</strong> Agencies providing IPS services are committed to competitive employment as an attainable goal for people with behavioral health conditions seeking employment. Mainstream education and specialized training may enhance career paths.</li>
<li>
<strong>Eligibility Based on Client Choice:</strong> People are not excluded on the basis of readiness, diagnoses, symptoms, substance use history, psychiatric hospitalizations, homelessness, level of disability, or legal system involvement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Integration of Rehabilitation and Mental Health Services:</strong> IPS programs are closely integrated with mental health treatment teams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Attention to Worker Preferences: </strong>Services are based on each person’s preferences and choices, rather than providers’ judgments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personalized Benefits Counseling:</strong> Employment specialists help people obtain personalized, understandable, and accurate information about their Social Security, Medicaid, and other government entitlements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rapid Job Search:</strong> IPS programs use a rapid job search approach to help job seekers obtain jobs directly, rather than providing lengthy pre-employment assessment, training, and counseling. If further education is part of their plan, IPS specialists assist in these activities as needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Systematic Job Development:</strong> Employment specialists systematically visit employers, who are selected based on job seeker preferences, to learn about their business needs and hiring preferences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Time-Unlimited and Individualized Support:</strong> Job supports are individualized and continue for as long as each worker wants and needs the support.</li>
</ol>



<p>IPS has been shown to significantly increase employment rates in countries around the world, as you can see in the chart from Emery and Rick’s presentation below.</p>



<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iTdyE5E8D7PvDSRsJ-PujZJo8lyqzSqFZQMkvpm8KlWhVGTBYkvcJpgd4m3daqgQFlw4R68e34Ha79EyB0vz28pPpr7de9nw7XIJABXNkrkJu18BmIgjlppLALXy3-O0aWyrdq7V">



<p>We hope this is the first conversation of many as ECS reaches out to our partners to integrate the highly successful model of IPS into our comprehensive system of care. As the lead agency overseeing coordinated entry into homeless services in San Francisco, our approach must continually evolve and adopt best practices like these.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By Beth Stokes<br>Executive Director, Episcopal Community Services</p>



<img src="https://ecs-sf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bryant-Navigation-Center-1024x614.jpg">Bryant Navigation Center



<p>Navigation Centers are a critical tool in the effort to end homelessness in San Francisco. They provide a low-barrier respite from the streets for a highly vulnerable population, in tandem with on-site case management, streamlined access to social services and medical care, and coordinated entry into pathways to permanent housing.</p>



<p>In 2015, Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco (ECS), in partnership with the City of San Francisco, opened the city’s first Navigation Center at 1950 Mission St. and currently manages the Central Waterfront and Bryant Navigation Centers. In addition, ECS provided training and support to 5 Keys, which manages the Bayshore Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Navigation Centers have shown strong signs of success in helping people exit homelessness, and they are different from traditional shelters in a number of ways. Navigation Centers have few barriers to entry and provide intensive case management to connect people to the unique care and housing solutions they need. They provide community space and welcome people with partners, pets, and possessions. Clients receive personalized support to help address housing barriers such as a lack of personal identity documents, employment opportunities, or histories of eviction.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-4405">
</span>



<p>

Navigation Centers represent an effort to provide a higher level of coordinated care in a managed environment, focused on working with our partners to help end chronic homelessness for people with the highest needs. 

</p>



<p>Navigation Centers provide:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On-site case management</li>
<li>City benefits specialists to assist with enrollment for Cal Fresh and General Assistance</li>
<li>On-site medical clinics</li>
<li>Harm reduction therapy services provided by a licensed clinician</li>
<li>Housing navigation for all – especially those with the highest needs, as assessed by the Coordinated Entry Team</li>
</ul>



<p>Since the Navigation Center program began over three years ago, it has helped 72% of 1,150 beneficiaries successfully exit homelessness, according to figures from the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. More than a dozen other U.S. cities are replicating this highly successful model.</p>



<p>We’ve also heard support for our existing centers from neighbors like Mike Sizemore, who lives across the street from the Bryant Navigation Center and shared his praise for the center’s impact in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLJiiX1wNqI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="video on Youtube (opens in a new tab)">video on Youtube</a>. “They make for some of the quietest neighbors,” he told the San Francisco Board of Supervisors at a recent hearing. “I have guests over many times a week and they are surprised that it isn’t a storage facility for how quiet it is.”</p>



<p>Kyle Conroy, who lives near the Central Waterfront Navigation Center in Dogpatch, also voiced his support at the hearing. “The center has been a huge positive for our neighborhood,” he said. “I hope that every district in San Francisco gets a Navigation Center. Our unsheltered neighbors deserve shelter.“</p>



<p>Centers like these are a key part of the broader effort to drive systemic change and solve problems of homelessness on a larger scale. Supporting them is part of being a good neighbor – to everyone.<br>

<p>
<strong>San Francisco, CA, April 8th, 2019 – </strong>Beth Stokes, Executive Director, and the Board of <a href="http://www.ecs-sf.org/index.html">Episcopal
Community Services</a> (ECS) of San Francisco, a leader in
San Francisco’s plan to create more supportive housing for individuals and
families experiencing homelessness, are proud to announce the organization’s 15<sup>th</sup>
annual CHEFS Gala fundraiser on May 2, 2019 from 6:30 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. at
Bespoke, located at<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=845+Market+Street&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g"> 845 Market Street</a> atop
Westfield Centre.</p>



<p>We are honored to welcome international
television icon, Master Chef, food consultant and prolific cookbook author,
Chef Martin as our celebrity emcee. Chef Yan is the recipient of numerous awards
and honors from The James Beard Foundation Awards, The Antonin Careme Medal,
The American Culinary Federation, and the American Academy of Chefs. We are
also pleased to announce Emmy Award-winning radio and TV personality Liam
Mayclem as our auctioneer for the evening. Mayclem is best known as the host of
Eye on the Bay on CBS 5 and “The Foodie Chap,” celebrating San Francisco Bay
Area culinary stars daily on KCBS Radio.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to partner with high caliber
foodies of Chef Martin and Liam Mayclem for this year’s Gala,” says ECS
Executive Director Beth Stokes. “Their support of ECS and the people we serve
is testimony to the necessity of addressing homelessness in San Francisco.”</p>



<p>CHEFS Gala seeks to raise awareness of ECS’s vital programs, including
the marquee CHEFS program. This 10-12 week culinary training program provides
people impacted by homelessness and poverty with technical and professional
skills through classroom instruction, hands-on kitchen training, and a local
food service internship.</p>



<p>“ECS Workforce Development Programs offer a vital component to help homeless individuals find housing through employment. Our CHEFS program offers those interested in the culinary field a roadmap not just towards employment but more importantly a career in the culinary industry,” said Jason Pruett, Director of Workforce Development &amp; Social Enterprise. “Along with the culinary skills attained, CHEFS helps to instill confidence and boost self-esteem in our participants setting them on a path towards a successful future. “</p>



<p>Guests at the event will enjoy tastings and
cocktails from a variety of the City’s finest restaurants and from ECS’s own
CHEFS program while participating in live and silent auctions. The fundraiser
aims to raise awareness about San Franciscans experiencing homelessness and
provide funds for housing, services, and job training for the 7,200 people who
access ECS’s services annually. The 15th Annual CHEFS Gala looks to build on
its momentum from previous years by creating even more opportunities for the
very low-income men, women, and children that ECS serves annually. </p>



<p>Many generous Bay Area restaurants,
wineries, and&nbsp;breweries&nbsp;are rallying behind ECS and its mission to
help homeless San Franciscans.&nbsp;Guests will enjoy bites from top San
Francisco restaurants including&nbsp;<strong>Sorrel,
Octavia, Nopa, Louie’s Gen-Gen Room at Liholiho Yacht Club, Smitten Ice
Cream,&nbsp;Boulevard, Delfina, Rooh</strong>, and more.&nbsp;Guests will enjoy
cocktails provided by <strong>Tonic Beverage
Catering</strong>, as well as libations from <strong>Maven,&nbsp;Petrichor
Wines, Bonny Doon Vineyard</strong>, and <strong>Pond
Farm Brewing.&nbsp;</strong>Tickets are now on
sale and can be purchased at<a href="http://www.chefsgalasf.org/">
chefsgalasf.org</a>.</p>



<p>For more than 35 years, ECS has pushed
boundaries through innovative programs such being chosen by the city of San
Francisco, in conjunction with Mercy Housing, to
build and operate San Francisco’s largest permanent supportive housing
development for formerly homeless people near Mission and 7th Streets. The
two-building development will provide permanent homes for up to 265 households
experiencing chronic homelessness, with 100 new units allocated to formerly
homeless seniors, age 62 or older. With prime Mission Street frontage and over
5,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space, the new 7th &amp; Mission
development will also be the spectacular new site of ECS’s CHEFS workforce
development program and an affiliated foodservice social enterprise. Since it’s
founding, over 1,000 formerly homeless and very low-income students have participated
in the CHEFS program.</p>



<p>Lead CHEFS Gala sponsors include staunch ECS supporters <strong>Bi-Rite Family of Businesses, Cahill Contractors LLC, Caritas Property Management, Heffernan Insurance Brokers, Herman Coliver Locus Architecture, MUFG Union Bank Foundation, Hood &amp; Strong, Keller &amp; Benvenutti LLP, San Francisco</strong> <strong>Federal Credit Union, Silicon Valley Bank, Sutter Health CPMC, Xantrion and Zendesk</strong>. </p>

<p>Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco (ECS) will operate the Bryant Street Navigation Center. In addition to Bryant, ECS also operates the Central Waterfront Navigation Center and previously operated the original Mission Navigation Center prior to its closure in October 2018.</p>
<p>“This Navigation Center is a critical tool in a broader effort to drive systemic change and solve problems of homelessness more effectively on a larger scale,” said Episcopal Community services Executive Director, Beth Stokes. “Navigation Centers provide low-barrier, low-threshold respite from the streets for a highly vulnerable population, in tandem with on-site case management, streamlined access to social services and coordinated entry into housing pathways.”</p>

The city has partnered with Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco (ECS) and other agencies to pilot new models to assist this highly vulnerable unsheltered population, many of whom have resisted entering the traditional shelter system for fear of losing their relationships, their pets, or their possessions.</p>

<p>Community Technology Network is an Episcopal Community Services of SF partner on the AB1299 Adoption Grant work, which is bringing digital literacy training and a free laptop to every unit of ECS owned housing at Canon Barcus, Canon Kip, and Bishop Swing. This Adoption Grant work was the second of a two part State of CA funding opportunity to help bridge the digital divide at ECS. The first was an Infrastructure Grant that allowed all three properties to be wired for free Wi-Fi for all residents. In addition, ECS has been working to bring free Wi-Fi and 24/7 community computers through a different avenue to the master leased properties, as they are not eligible for AB1299 grant.</p>
<p>As a result of the hard work from so many dedicated and persistent ECS staff members, we are proud to say that ECS offers free Wi-Fi to every resident at every one of our properties and a device on which to access that Wi-Fi!</p>

<p>Community Technology Network is an Episcopal Community Services of SF partner on the AB1299 Adoption Grant work, which is bringing digital literacy training and a free laptop to every unit of ECS owned housing at Canon Barcus, Canon Kip, and Bishop Swing.</p>
<p>This Adoption Grant work was the second of a two part State of CA funding opportunity to help bridge the digital divide at ECS. The first was an Infrastructure Grant that allowed all three properties to be wired for free Wi-Fi for all residents. In addition, ECS has been working to bring free Wi-Fi and 24/7 community computers through a different avenue to the master leased properties, as they are not eligible for AB1299 grant.</p>
<p>As a result of the hard work from so many dedicated and persistent ECS staff members, we are proud to say that ECS offers free Wi-Fi to every resident at every one of our properties and a device on which to access that Wi-Fi!</p>

</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, May 14th, 2018 — Episcopal Community Services (ECS) of San Francisco, a leader in San Francisco’s plan to create more supportive housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, is proud to announce its 14th annual CHEFS Gala fundraiser on June 7, 2018 from 6:30 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. at Bespoke, located at 845 Market Street atop Westfield Centre.</p>
<p>Guests at the event will enjoy tastings and cocktails from 22 of the City’s best restaurants while participating in live and silent auctions. The fundraiser aims to raise awareness about San Franciscans experiencing homelessness and provide funds for housing, services and job training for the 7,000 people who access ECS’s services annually. A year after its most successful event yet, the 14th Annual CHEFS Gala looks to build on its momentum by creating even more opportunities for the very low income men, women and children whom ECS serves annually. Tickets are now on sale and can be purchased at <a href="http://chefsgalasf.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chefsgalasf.org</a>.</p>
<p>As San Francisco’s fastest-growing provider of supportive housing, ECS is committed to finding solutions to end homelessness by helping individuals and families gain the tools necessary to exit homelessness, from shelter to housing to employment services. The organization provides approximately half of San Francisco’s shelter beds for single adults and 96% of the formerly homeless residents who access ECS housing remain permanently housed. Starting July 1, ECS is implementing a, first of its kind in San Francisco, coordinated access system of care.</p>
<p>For more than 35 years, ECS has pushed boundaries through innovative programs such as the City’s first Navigation Center, which offers intensive case management, temporary shelter, and services to help homeless people find permanent housing. Most recently, the city of San Francisco selected ECS, in conjunction with Mercy Housing, to build and operate San Francisco’s largest permanent supportive housing development for formerly homeless people near Mission and 7th Streets. The two-building development will provide permanent homes for up to 265 households experiencing chronic homelessness, with 100 new units allocated to formerly homeless seniors, age 62 or older.</p>
<p>Many generous San Francisco restaurants are rallying behind ECS and its mission to help homeless San Franciscans. Bites from recently named “Top 100 Restaurants” (San Francisco Chronicle) Bellota, jū-ni, Nopa, Robin and Rooh will be provided, along with delicious dishes from Bi-Rite Market, Dosa, Flour + Water, Lolinda, Media Noche and many more. Students from ECS’s CHEFS (Conquering Homelessness through Employment in Food Services) training program will serve their own tasty treats<br>
as well. Guests will enjoy cocktails provided by Tonic Beverage Catering, as well as tastings from Magnolia Brewing Company, Scribe Winery, and Chimney Rock.</p>
<p>CHEFS Gala seeks to raise awareness and $400,000 to support ECS’s vital programs, including the marquee CHEFS program. This five-month culinary training program provides people impacted by homelessness and poverty with technical and professional skills through classroom instruction, hands-on kitchen training, and a local food service internship.</p>
<p>“The sense of accomplishment our students gain by participating in and meeting industry professionals through CHEFS really begins to change the way they view themselves,” said Melanie Brew, CHEFS program director. “CHEFS empowers students to consider futures in which they have a say in how they lead their lives, while giving them the opportunity to do something that brings them happiness and a sense of purpose.”</p>
<p>
<em>Lead sponsors include staunch ECS supporters Cahill Contractors LLC, Heffernan Insurance Brokers, Herman Coliver Locus Architecture, MUFGU Union Bank Foundation, Hood &amp; Strong, Keller &amp; Benvenutti LLP, Silicon Valley Bank, Good Job Brothers, Market Design Furniture, Inc., and Xantrion. Leslie Sbrocco, host of the PBS restaurant review series Check Please! will emcee.</em>
