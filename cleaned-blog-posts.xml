</p>



<p>We are getting ready for the annual winter meeting this January in Chicago (which can be very pleasant some years). Last year there was a blizzard. While we do not have the list of resolutions to be discussed, there will be a couple Veterinary Information Forum (VIF) Topics.</p>



<p>
<strong>Environmental Scanning: HOD Membership Criteria</strong>
</p>



<p>This is the ongoing discussion regarding&nbsp;criteria for obtaining and retaining membership&nbsp;in the&nbsp;HOD&nbsp;as a constituent allied veterinary&nbsp;organization, such as <strong>AAIV</strong>. This discussion will help guide the working group that will be appointed to address this important issue.</p>



<p>I<strong>nformational Session: Veterinary Technician Training and Education</strong>
</p>



<p>This will explore the current trends and challenges in veterinary technician training and education, including accreditation best practices, career advancement and the importance of collaborative models within the veterinary teams.

<strong>Dear AAIV Members,</strong>
</p>



<p>As we welcome the fall season and approach the holidays, I find myself reflecting on my time as AAIV President with deep gratitude and excitement for the future. It’s hard to believe how quickly this year has flown by—wasn’t it just spring yesterday? Whether you’re already ahead on holiday shopping or, like me, still wondering when you’ll find the time, I hope you’re embracing the season’s energy and joy.</p>



<p>Serving as AAIV President has been an absolute honor. I am continually inspired by the dedication, talent, and warmth of our members—people who are passionate about making a difference in industry. Thank you for the trust you placed in me and for the privilege of working alongside such a vibrant network.</p>



<p>This year, our mentorship program, events and the connections we’ve fostered have truly strengthened our community. I’m especially grateful to our outgoing board members who contributed to AAIV’s success. Your enthusiasm and support have made a real impact – Thank you!</p>



<p>It’s now time to pass the baton. In January, Dr. Carolyn Luther from Hill’s Pet Nutrition will step into the role of AAIV president. Carolyn brings energy, vision and a deep commitment to our organization, and I’m confident she will lead AAIV to new heights. We’re also thrilled to welcome our incoming board members, whose dedication will be instrumental in our ongoing mission.</p>



<p>Are you headed to VMX? Don’t miss our morning coffee networking reception! Mark your calendars for <strong>Sunday, January 18, 7:30–9 a.m.</strong>, at the Plaza Intl Ballroom F in the Hyatt Regency Orlando. Enjoy breakfast, coffee and the chance to connect with fellow industry veterinarians and technicians—whether you’re exploring new opportunities or catching up with old friends.</p>



<p>Plus, our Learning and Leadership track returns! On Saturday, industry experts will speak on topics from leading from where you are now to mastering the art of strategic overreach. On Monday and Tuesday, virtual sessions will be offered on several topics, including mentorship for career transition, virtual networking tips in vet med and more. Lastly, the VMX Masterclass on Veterinary Resume and Interview Skills will be held on Tuesday at 8 a.m.; expertise provided by Stacy Pursell and Dr. Debra Nickelson. These sessions are a fantastic opportunity to learn, grow and network!</p>



<p>As I transition out of this role, I’m excited to see AAIV continue to grow under Carolyn’s leadership and our new board. We’re eager to hear your ideas for how AAIV can best support you in 2026 and beyond. Please share your comments, suggestions or dreams for the future—let’s shape the next chapter together!</p>



<p>Thank you for your continued support and for making AAIV such a special community. Wishing you a safe, healthy and happy holiday season. Here’s to the future!</p>



<p>
<strong>With gratitude,</strong>
</p>

<strong>Dear AAIV Members,</strong>
</p>



<p>This morning, as I gathered yet another generous bowl of cherry tomatoes from my garden, I couldn’t help but notice that the trees in my backyard are starting to lose their vibrant green — signaling the first hints of autumn. I welcome the cooler weather and the beautiful colors that fall brings. And truth be told, I’m also ready for my garden to slow down — I’m running out of creative ways to use all these tomatoes!</p>



<p>I’m equally excited about what AAIV has planned for this fall season. First up, our autumn webinar is scheduled <strong>from Noon to 1 p.m. CT</strong> <strong>on Sept. 8</strong>. Our topic, <em>Generative AI</em>, is one that’s capturing everyone’s attention. Many of us have heard that AI can boost productivity and reduce stress but might feel unsure about where to start. This session will provide a foundational introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence and its expanding role across professional and creative fields. We’ll explore how generative AI models learn patterns, predict content and create original outputs like text and images. Through engaging activities and thoughtful discussions on ethics, you’ll gain practical experience using AI tools for brainstorming, writing and personalized learning. If you haven’t registered already, you can do so <a href="https://aaivet.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/aaivet/eventRegistration.jsp?event=97">here</a>. This webinar is complimentary for all AAIV members and offers 1 hour of RACE-approved CE credit.</p>



<p>Following that, we’ll host a virtual all-member meeting <strong>at 5-6:30 p.m. CT on Tuesday, Oct. 7</strong>. This is your chance to hear updates on AAIV’s key initiatives — mentorship, educational webinars, networking, representation in the AVMA House of Delegates and more. Most importantly, we want to hear from you! How can we better support you as an industry veterinarian? What topics matter most to you? What educational content would you like us to offer? I encourage you to join this informative session. Let us know you plan to join <a href="https://aaivet.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/aaivet/eventRegistration.jsp?event=92">here</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, the AAIV elections are coming up in October. Are you interested in serving on our board? Or do you know someone who would be a great fit? We are currently accepting applications for the positions of President-Elect, Vice President of Marketing and External Communications, Vice President of Internal Communications and three Board Member roles. For detailed position descriptions, please click <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/mcusercontent.com/c3f96b5f8485092d6fad5c098/files/57c3e6ba-d248-d185-effa-af4e059601d3/AAIV_Board_Member_and_Officer_Position_Description_Updated_8_2024_5_.docx__;!!NI2rKV_i!4bCCHpOMoxuTXxu396fD3a7DrBLgGFoVaGXNi3B3AyLzkzSAtZjPOap-P_kbRrqdC5VD3FD7pWM1Krs$">here</a>. To be considered, submit your completed <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/mcusercontent.com/c3f96b5f8485092d6fad5c098/files/104a470c-2f78-5238-1cbd-29bd902d1eb6/Board_Member_and_Officer_Nomination_Form.pdf__;!!NI2rKV_i!4bCCHpOMoxuTXxu396fD3a7DrBLgGFoVaGXNi3B3AyLzkzSAtZjPOap-P_kbRrqdC5VD3FD7eryB4co$">candidate nomination form</a> to <a href="mailto:industryvets@aaivet.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industryvets@aaivet.org</a> by <strong>5 p.m. CT on Thursday, Oct</strong>. <strong>9</strong>. Voting will take place from Oct. 14-28. Newly elected officers and board members will be notified in early November and invited to join the December 2025 board meeting to meet the team.</p>



<p>Whether at the fall webinar or the all-member meeting, I look forward to connecting with you soon. I’d love to hear your ideas on how we can make AAIV even better — and if you have any favorite recipes or creative uses for cherry tomatoes, please do share!</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>

<strong>By&nbsp;Tim Smaha, D.V.M. AAIV Alternate Delegate to the AVMA HOD</strong>
</p>



<p>The AVMA officers, board of directors, and house of delegates met in Washington D.C. in conjunction with the annual AVMA conference. The HOD meeting was a full two days of meeting with AVMA leadership that included legislative fly-in to meet with congress about two bills that AVMA is working to get passed in this congress.                                                                                                                                             </p>



<p>
<br>On Thursday July 17, the members of AVMA leadership and the house of delegates met with lawmakers from all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico to gain sponsorship and support for two bills currently in committee in this congress. The first is the Rural Veterinary Workforce Act which has bipartisan support. The bill would essentially help relieve rural veterinarians who work with public health or food animals of the tax burdens that they currently face. A similar bill was passed in 2002 for medical doctors, and this bill has been introduced in congress for several years under the name Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act. The second bill currently in congress is the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act. This bill is supported by the AVMA and aims to have Xylazine scheduled as a DEA schedule III drug as soon as possible and allow for protection of xylazine that is used for veterinary purposes.</p>



<p>During the meeting, election was held for President Elect of AVMA and Dr. Jennifer Quammen was voted into office. The one council position which had an open vote included the Council on Veterinary Service (CoVS) recent graduate or emerging leader position. Dr. Tara Fellows Barron immediate past president of SCAVMA was elected into that position. The CoVS position for credentialed veterinary technician also had no nominations and will remain open.</p>



<p>The last election that took place was for the House Advisory Committee. There were three at large positions up for election and they were filled by Dr. Stuart Brown and Dr. Diana Thome being reelected for a second term. Dr. Christopher Gargamelli of Boehringer Ingelheim was elected to the third HAC open position.</p>



<p>We also had nominations for Vice President elect and president elect and both saw one nominee — Dr. Bob Knapp from Ohio for the President Elect position and Dr. Elizabeth Boggier of New Jersey for Vice President Elect.</p>



<p>The conclusion was voting on a series of resolutions to existing policies that had been reviewed by the Food Animal Safety Committee and the Animal Welfare Committee. All resolutions passed and included minor modifications since committee review. </p>



<p>Pediatric Sterilization of Dogs, Cats and Rabbits<br>Therapeutic Pet Food Health Claims<br>Sow Housing<br>Declawing of Domestic Cats<br>Pain in Animals<br>
<br>There were several changes to the Model Veterinary Practice act that had been referred from the 2022 session. These were presented as a single resolution that encompassed rearrangement of the MVPA into relevant groups of sections, nomenclature for licensed veterinary technicians (and eliminating credentialed and registered to highlight the licensing process. A new section was added to the MVPA to further define telemedicine and the use of telemedicine in practice. The changes the MVPA were passed. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Key Lessons Learned at the Intersection of Science and Business</strong>
</h5>



<p>When I made the decision to step into the world of business, I never imagined the depth of lessons I would learn along the way. Science and business are not two separate worlds; they are intertwined, each feeding off the other, creating something much bigger than the sum of their parts. In my early days, I relied heavily on my scientific background, thinking it would be enough to navigate the business world. After all, science is grounded in evidence, logic and experimentation. What could go wrong?</p>



<p>But soon, I realized that business isn’t just about data! It is about people, communication, style, relationships and creativity. It’s about knowing how to apply the scientific principles to create real-world value. So, the data in the paper is not enough if it is only a theory.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Lesson #1:</em>
</strong>
<em> Science Without Business Is Incomplete</em>
</p>



<p>Science is big and it is powerful alone! But this does not mean you can always translate science into success in business. I could analyze data, interpret results and create solutions, but I had to learn how to communicate scientific ideas effectively. Business taught me that understanding customers’ needs, developing a strategy and managing resources were at least as necessary as the scientific results. In other words, if you don’t understand the market, the regulatory environment and how to build the brand, even the most groundbreaking scientific discovery can fall short. Take science as the foundation and create the business as a structure – they are good together!</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Lesson #2: </em>
</strong>
<em>Failures Are the Best Teachers</em>
</p>



<p>It took a decade for me to accept failures as opportunities! In my early career days, any failure felt like the end of the world, at least the product or project. Then I looked back one day and realized that my failures have been my greatest teachers. After that day when something went wrong, I just saw it as an opportunity to adjust, learn and grow. Remember that failure isn’t a reflection of your capabilities but a part of the journey. Enjoy and welcome them when they happen, then learn from, correct and proceed.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Lesson #3: </em>
</strong>
<em>Small Steps Lead to Big Wins</em>
</p>



<p>One obvious outcome from my two decades of experience was: “Success rarely comes in a single leap. It usually is a series of small, intentional steps.” You can see how they become giant strides by taking small steps every day. Consistency is the key! Even a little something becomes a great buildup with consistent work, leading you to significant achievements.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Lesson #4: </em>
</strong>
<strong>Build Strong, Meaningful Relationships</strong>
</p>



<p>If you cannot be the queen or king of networking (like me, thanks to ADHD), immediately find one for yourself and love them so much! Focusing only on research, results and data is easy and enough in the scientific world. But in business, relationships are everything. I learned that the success of my company was not just about the science behind the ideas and products; it was about the people I worked with, the connections I made and the networks I built. Don’t make a big collection of new business cards! Focus on the collection of meaningful relationships with the people who challenge you, support you and push you to grow. And be grateful to them – they are your true assets.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Lesson #5: </em>
</strong>
<em>Adaptability Is Key to Survival</em>
</p>



<p>If you ask me about a similarity between science and business, I say things will not go as planned, every time! An experiment might fail, but this is the beauty of science, right? We call it the ever-evolving process of learning and adapting! The same is true in business. No matter how carefully you plan, there will always be unforeseen challenges. The key is adaptability. When the market shifts or regulations change, being able to adjust your strategy is crucial. Thus, you must be <em>flexible</em> and open-minded, not to fear changing directions when necessary.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
<em>My Final Words</em>
</strong>
</h5>



<p>The corner of science and business streets is a joyful and solid place, but it requires more than just expertise in one area. It requires blending knowledge with creativity, data with people and experimentation with strategy.</p>



<p>Most importantly, it requires resilience. Accepting failure is an essential part of the journey. Find the right people who would share their knowledge and experience with you. And most importantly, trust the process. Trust yourself!</p>



<p>
<strong>You’ve got this!</strong>

</p>



<p>Years spent at one of the most rigorous universities. Heavy, thick, intimidating textbooks had to memorize word for word. Endless hours to learn and understand not only animals, but also nature, science and <em>life</em> itself. After nights and days full of headaches and doing your best, you finally graduated with a veterinary degree.</p>



<p>Congratulations! Well… but now what?</p>



<p>For me, the shift from veterinary science to international entrepreneurship was anything but straightforward. It was a winding path filled with challenges, doubts and invaluable lessons. Over time, I discovered that failure isn’t a dead end but a stepping stone. When the day comes, the obstacles become the beautiful building blocks in your success story. Science and business complement each other in ways most people don’t realize. Science and business, when combined, can unlock fantastic possibilities far beyond the lab bench.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>From Science to the Greatest Unknown</strong>
</h5>



<p>My journey began in Türkiye, where I earned my D.V.M. and later a Ph.D in Microbiology. As a child, I dreamed of becoming a professor and spending my life in academia, researching and teaching. And for a time, I lived that dream. I was teaching undergraduates and diving deep into microbiological studies.</p>



<p>Yet something felt incomplete – like I was holding only a tiny slice of a much larger pizza! So, I made what seemed like a logical next step: joining a private animal health lab. Sounds safe, predictable and comfortable, right? It was another small step… But still not what would make me feel fulfilled! Deep down, I knew I wanted something different, something more. Something that not only helps animals and makes science but also reaches out to the whole world. So, I chose uncertainty instead of following the expected path in my comfort zone. Yes, I did!</p>



<p>I began working with a company to import, manufacture and distribute its first probiotic products for animal health while still in my twenties. I’ll admit that at that time I barely understood the difference between import and export! But I dove in, learning on the job. While keeping up with the latest in intestinal biochemistry, I was also memorizing international Harmonized System codes and regulatory standards from around the world. Each challenge, from negotiating EU compliance updates to training veterinarians and pharmacists, made me stronger — even if I didn’t always know where it would lead. There was no master plan. Just a sense that the answers I sought weren’t confined to the classroom or the lab.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Never forget:</em>
</strong>
<em> The best school is the job itself! Plus, you get paid to learn!</em>
</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Follow Your Instinct Without a Map</strong>
</h5>



<p>Leaving the safety of a traditional career path can be terrifying. Even with a PhD and years of experience, uncertainty never completely disappears. But I learned not to seek comfort—instead, I sought purpose.</p>



<p>If you feel pulled toward something different, listen. That instinct, that gut feeling (or call it sixth sense) often holds more wisdom than we credit it for.</p>



<p>A wise businessman once told me, “<em>You don’t need the full picture to take the first step. Just start and take small steps, then show up every day</em>.” And that advice has guided me ever since. I showed up every day, took incremental steps and trusted the process. Not every effort led to success, but each taught me something. In time, I found that the most meaningful opportunities often appear when you take calculated risks, even when the plan is incomplete.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>In Summary</strong>
</h5>



<p>Taking a leap of faith is scary, and taking risks often feels terrible. But they usually bring the most fulfilling success stories. Trust the process. Trust yourself.</p>



<p>
<br>Head over to <strong>
<a href="https://aaivet.org/from-science-to-business-as-a-dvm-part-2/">Part 2</a>
</strong>, where I’ll share the key lessons I learned at the intersection of science and business — and how failure can become your most fantastic teacher.</p>

<p>My “must have” is my AirPods, I always travel with my AirPods because I use them so often during my trips.  If I’m flying, I use them to watch a show or listen to music if I’m working. I also use it in my hotel’s gym while I work out.  If I’m on the road or in an airport and I need to join a work call, my AirPods are a great way to tune in while in public places to listen in.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear AAIV Members,</p>



<p>Spring is one of my favorite times of year. I usually find myself dreaming about planting my garden or getting on my paddleboard for that first trip across the lake.</p>



<p>This year, I confess, my heart is a little more somber. At work, I serve an area that has been particularly hard hit by storms and flooding. I see economic uncertainty creating anxiety for people, both at home and at work. Many of our veterinary colleagues have been affected by recent changes at federal agencies.</p>



<p>That’s why I am grateful to be part of an organization that helps veterinarians and technicians grow and thrive in the face of change. One of my favorite initiatives is our mentorship program. Members seeking their first role in industry can ask to be paired with a tenured industry professional. I’ve heard some truly inspiring stories from this group. You can read several mentee’s stories <a href="https://aaivet.org/mentoring/">here</a>. I hope you will consider participating in our <a href="https://aaivet.org/mentoring/">mentorship program</a> today.</p>



<p>AAIV also provides continuing education to help members develop as professionals. Our next webinar is on May 22, <a href="https://aaivet.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/aaivet/eventRegistration.jsp?event=82">
<em>How to Break Into Non-Clinical Veterinary Jobs</em>
</a>. Whether you’re a veterinarian or a technician, this webinar is meant to guide you through your transition from clinical practice to an industry role.</p>



<p>Are you working in industry but contemplating your next career step? Don’t forget that members can access our <a href="https://aaivet.org/inspire_events/?past=true&amp;post_type=inspire_events">archive</a> of past webinars. Recent offerings have included titles such as <em>Getting to the Interview and Winning It</em>, <em>How to Become and Stay Relevant in Changing Times</em>, and <em>Leveraging LinkedIn to Grow Your Professional Network</em>.</p>



<p>If you are planning to attend the upcoming AVMA Convention in Washington, D.C., please check out <a href="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AVMA-2025-AAIV-sponsored-events-flyer_FNL-1.pdf">AAIV’s CE offerings</a> at the conference. I’d also love to meet you at our morning <a href="https://aaivet.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/aaivet/eventRegistration.jsp?event=77">networking reception</a>. Enjoy a cup of coffee and a bagel while connecting with fellow industry veterinarians. There is no better way to exchange ideas and expand your professional network. </p>



<p>In closing, I want to thank you for your continued participation in AAIV. We are always looking for new ways to serve our members. Do <em>you</em> have an idea for a program, webinar or resource? Please reach out! This is your organization, and we want to hear from <a href="https://forms.gle/Ppm3TYaUVJj1WzYUA">
<em>YOU</em>!</a>
</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>

<strong>By Debra Nickelson, D.V.M. AAIV Delegate to the AVMA HOD</strong>
</p>



<p>One of the most interesting roles of the House of Delegates is to vote for the AVMA President-Elect every year. While the states have a number of votes based on AVMA member population in each state, the allied organizations such as AAIV have one vote each. We do want to represent your interests for the next AVMA President-Elect 2025-2026 who will automatically become President 2026-2027. Please review the information about the two candidates for 2025-2026 AVMA President-Elect and let us know your thoughts and questions. Our vote is your vote!</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mary-Ergen-avma-president-elect-candidate-2025-150x150.png">



<p>
<strong>Dr. Mary Ergen</strong> is former District III representative on the AVMA Board of Directors, representing AVMA members in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. She currently serves as director of rehabilitation at Canine Rehabilitation of Nashville.</p>



<p>Dr. Ergen says, “I would like to continue to move our strategic plan forward, to see our technician initiatives materialize, streamline the Educational Commission on Foreign Veterinary Graduates and continue to support our legislative issues. I am bullish on the AVMA. I think I can work well with our volunteers and other stakeholders to solve the current issues of workforce imbalance, the availability and validity of telehealth and the use of (artificial intelligence) in our profession as just a few examples.”</p>



<p>The 1982 graduate of the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine has been active in organized veterinary medicine for more than 30 years, including serving as president of the Tennessee VMA in 2008. She also was the Tennessee alternate delegate in the HOD for seven years.</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jen-Quammen-avma-president-elect-2025-150x150.png">



<p>
<strong>Dr. Jennifer Quammen</strong> is former Vice-President of AVMA and currently serves at Chief Veterinary Officer at Otto. <a href="https://jenquammen.com/">Here is her website</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Quammen says she is running for president-elect because she is eager to contribute to a profession that has enriched her life. “I have the foundational skills in communication and collaboration.”</p>



<p>A 2011 graduate of The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Quammen has served as president of the Kentucky VMA (KVMA) as well as co-facilitator of the KVMA’s Power of Ten leadership program. Dr. Quammen is an alumna of the AVMA Future Leaders Program and has served as chair of the AVMA Council on Veterinary Service.</p>



<p>“AVMA cannot be everywhere at all times, nor can I,” she said, “but we can serve as a place to bring differing opinions into the same room—virtual or in real time—and find common ground to have respectful discussions.”</p>



<p>Please send any comments or questions to AAIV at <a href="mailto:industryvet@gmail.com">industryvet@gmail.com</a>. As always, thank you for your support and we are here for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear AAIV Members,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever I gaze at a snow-covered landscape, I feel a sense of peace and serenity. That Zen moment is a welcome respite during this busy season. Trade shows, company meetings, educational events and, of course, family commitments, keep our lives moving at a fast pace in winter.</p>



<p>I couldn’t be more honored to step into the role of AAIV President at this time. I am grateful for the trust you’ve placed in me, and I’m excited to work with such a creative, enthusiastic board. I’d like to extend a special welcome to our new board members:  Doctors AJ Joshi, Jim Lowe, Shirin Modaresi and Jason Pozzuoli, as well as our inaugural technician board member, Jamie Rauscher, LVT.</p>



<p>This year, we’re planning to continue work that enhances AAIV’s mission: to promote the value of veterinarians in human and animal healthcare industries. Now that we’ve added veterinary technicians to our membership, we’ll strive to elevate their vital roles in industry, too.</p>



<p>One of our primary objectives is to bring members together to meet and exchange ideas. If you attended our networking event at VMX, thank you! If you couldn’t join us, I hope you’ll consider attending our socials at the <a href="https://aaivet.org/inspire_events/aaiv-networking-event-at-wvc-2025/">WVC at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas</a>, and at the AVMA Convention in Washington, D.C., in July (registration for this event coming soon!).</p>



<p>AAIV offers other benefits too. Live and virtual CE focuses on educational topics pertinent to veterinary professionals working outside clinical practice. Our mentorship program helps professionals prepare for their first job in industry. Our work on behalf of industry professionals in the AVMA House of Delegates is ongoing.</p>



<p>One of the goals of this year’s board is to find more ways to enrich membership in AAIV. If you’ve made it to the end of this letter, I hope you’ll take a moment to respond. What do you like best about AAIV? How can we better serve you? If you have an idea for a CE event or other program, <a href="industryvets@aaivet.org">please share it with us</a>.</p>



<p>I look forward to hearing from you. I hope this will be the beginning of an interesting and productive conversation.</p>



<p>With gratitude,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Jim Lowe, D.V.M. – Vice President of External Communications and Marketing</p>



<p>My “must have” is not a cutting-edge piece of IT, the latest travel-chic packing solution, or a favorite snack.</p>



<p>It’s a bit tattered and worn, both from age and miles, and far removed from the newness it once possessed.&nbsp; It’s multi-colored, stuffed, and is approximately 10 inches tall.&nbsp; It is packed for every trip, and when forgotten, it is immediately noticed upon checking in to the night’s hotel.</p>



<p>It is a teddy bear, more specifically, it is Peef.&nbsp; Peef came to our family when our daughter was very young and accompanied a book by the same name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My wife and I lived and practiced side-by-side for over 12 years. Every minute of every day we knew where we each were and how each of our days was going. So, the decision to leave private practice for industry disrupted not only our professional lives, but, most importantly, it turned our personal lives upside down. Our daughter was two years old when I began the life of a traveling technical services veterinarian, and leaving a young family at home did stimulate a lot of self-reflection as to the kind of dad- and husband-material I was. Peef represented the part of my family that got to travel with me and he’s been my travel companion since those early days. He’s a reminder of what’s most important, a symbol of how fast our daughter is growing up and someone to talk to upon returning to the hotel room. He has coffee with me in the mornings and is in-charge of the hotel room when I’m not around.</p>



<p>Travel with something sentimental. Something that has no utility but reminds you why you do what you do and who you do it for.</p>



<p>

<p>Do you have a “must have?” If so, we would love to hear about it! Email us at <a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>By&nbsp;Debra Nickelson, D.V.M., AAIV Delegate to the AVMA HOD</strong>
</p>



<p>The House of Delegates for the AVMA met during the Veterinary Leadership Symposium Jan. 9-11 in Chicago. It snowed there too, but we were inside watching it. Dr. Tim Smaha and I represent The American Association of Industry Veterinarians. During this meeting, Dr. Carolyn Luther, our President-Elect took Dr. Smaha’s place. Please send any comments or questions to AAIV at <a href="mailto:industryvet@gmail.com">industryvet@gmail.com</a>. As always, thank you for your support and we are here for you.</p>



<p>
<strong>Resolutions</strong>
</p>



<p>There were 8 resolutions brought forward to the House of Delegates for review. Such resolutions are brought to the House if a new policy is created, an existing policy needs changes, if the Board of Directors determines the policy to be pertinent or if a state or allied organization puts forth a policy.</p>



<p>A new policy on <strong>Rules for AVMA Officer Election Campaigns</strong> was referred back to the house advisory committee for revision and clarification, especially on guidelines for funding and social media.</p>



<p>Dr. Scott Dee (MN) submitted a policy on <strong>Evidence-Based Biosecurity</strong> to protect the health and welfare of humans and animals. The resolution passed after taking out “evidence-based” and recommending that AVMA develop a list of resources for veterinarians to use.</p>



<p>Massachusetts submitted a policy on <strong>The Role of Veterinary Medicine in Advancing Cellular Agriculture for Food Security and Animal Welfare</strong>. While delegates seemed to agree that veterinarians should be <em>at</em> the table and not <em>on</em> the table, people did not agree with some of the inflammatory language about animal agriculture. The resolution did not pass and the topic will be sent to the emerging technologies group for further work.</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Removal of Antlers (Velveting)</strong> passed in that the AVMA discourages the practice of removing living antlers for non-therapeutic purposes. This does not apply to hardened non-viable antlers.</p>



<p>Some of the Allied Groups, including AAIV asked that AVMA reconsider the minimum percentage of AVMA members of the total allied organization membership in order for the allied organization to be included in the House of Delegates. This was sparked by the policy on <strong>Annual Membership Dues Increases</strong> which passed. There will be a dues increase of $20 for the year 2026 and additional dues increases from 2027-2030 at the Board’s discretion.</p>



<p>The revised policy on <strong>Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Veterinary Medicine</strong> passed in that these modalities should be held to the same standards as traditional medical therapies.</p>



<p>A new policy on <strong>License by Endorsement</strong> passed after it was made clear to affect only veterinarians and veterinary technicians (not some other mid-level practitioner group, as the delegate in CO asked). This allows temporary licensure for qualified applicants until approval is finalized.</p>



<p>The Steering Committee on Human-Animal Interactions revised a policy on <strong>Guidelines for Pet Ownership</strong> to consider diversity, equity, inclusivity and more non-judgmental wording. It passed.</p>



<p>The actual resolutions are listed here:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear AAIV Members,&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we welcome the fall season, I find myself writing my final message as President of AAIV. It’s been an absolute honor to serve in this role and to be part of such a dedicated community of veterinarians in industry. I’m incredibly grateful for the trust you placed in me and for the chance to work alongside so many talented, passionate professionals.</p>



<p>I’d like to give a warm welcome to Dr. Ann Korbel, who will be stepping into the role of President. I know Ann will bring energy, vision, and continued dedication to leading AAIV into the future. We’re also thrilled to welcome our incoming board members, whose commitment will be instrumental in AAIV’s ongoing mission.</p>



<p>To our outgoing board and each of you who contributed to AAIV this year, thank you. Your support, enthusiasm, and contributions have made a real impact and have strengthened our community. I’m proud of all we’ve accomplished together—from our mentorship programs and events to the incredible network we continue to build.</p>



<p>As I transition out of this role, I’m looking forward to seeing how AAIV will continue to grow under Ann’s leadership. Thank you all for the privilege of serving, and here’s to the future!</p>



<p>With gratitude,</p>

<p>Things I can’t live without when I travel, Part 2: Tech Items</p>



<p>I have been working in animal health for 12 years now, and some of these items have been with me almost as long!</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Angle-extension-cord.png">


<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extension-Polarized-Christmas-SPS1032WE-27/dp/B07Y2BM2SR/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1L91TYDE5JLSM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uK1bEZeNdSAR3hFIj7lryKcKpV_RKcspr9qJPoZOtmVGiZgiPzW5m1kju502kaGqfDrZ_6fEVqI-UDIW0ZUO9DEMzU4R_uTrSyXqLu75_kNZtYGD4UZTkdQemujZNZQhFDye41bm8Fc5n3p_6hv5w26iVa8EuBlHKqjvdLKI4GCicHCFlwnGNhdIXqGizc6csQM5dXlmopcum5v02dW1Z5lxij0hSrqoxZcMAGRpPRbb0idTRCPYVDfUjwmy9wLGekxOagFiuwXtIXT2DVbBTU79b18XzHiec_9bDpManeg.Vg13rKsVrZHcftlNbKx28gFJDFmM-yif5xxlntkdgCs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=15%2Bft%2Bflathead%2Bextension%2Bcord&amp;qid=1729192000&amp;sprefix=15%2Bft%2Bflathead%2Bextension%2Bcord%2Caps%2C94&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1">15ft/flat head/angle extension cord</a> – for those hotels that do not have modern plug in options, this guy will fit nearly anywhere! I like it separate from my surge protector because if space is at a premium I can leave the extension cord at home.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Portable-Surge-Protector.png">


<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB64NHKF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AB6XQNH37T3H5ENZC3K3_1&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AB6XQNH37T3H5ENZC3K3_1&amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AB6XQNH37T3H5ENZC3K3_1&amp;th=1">Portable Surge Protector</a> – This is not the same one I have but I would buy it if I was shopping today. I also recommend compiling a full set of dedicated adapter cords to live in your suitcase – separate from those in your computer “personal” bag.</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>Personal bag/laptop bag – This bag must have a strap that slides over the extended handle of my carry on, roomy for lots of things including my purse, and still look nice enough to carry into meetings. A laptop charger lives in this bag, plus a whole set of all the other cords I need.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Portable-screen.png">


<p>
<a href="https://a.co/d/4iRSBGl">Portable screen</a> – If you do a lot of work that is easiest with 2 screens, then don’t let travel slow you down! These weigh nearly nothing, fit in the bottom of the carry or in my personal bag, and make admin work on the road much less miserable.</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>Lastly – I always have to have my iPhone Notes App: When I decide I need to add something, or something is missing, or my face wash is almost out, I have a running list I keep on my phone.  I usually just throw clothes in an hour before I am leaving on a trip and I hate showing up on a trip missing something because I forgot I needed to restock!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>By Debra Nickelson, D.V.M., AAIV Delegate to the AVMA HOD</strong>
</p>



<p>What does representation in the House of Delegates mean for members of the American Association of Industry Veterinarians?  AAIV is one of many allied organizations represented in the House of Delegates. Other allied organizations are the species groups, government groups, specialty groups, and our favorite, SAVMA.</p>



<p>Your delegates, Dr. Tim Smaha and I look at each resolution and information topic with eyes and ears for the interest of animal and human health companies, especially regarding the veterinarians who work or may want to work with these companies. We discuss the topics with the AAIV board of directors at our monthly meetings and often survey the mailing list for insight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, AAIV invites candidates for AVMA President-Elect and AVMA Vice-President to virtually join a board meeting to present their candidacy and answer questions. As candidates are announced a year before the actual election, we welcome your comments before we cast the AAIV vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, AAIV looks for open positions on AVMA councils, committees and task forces in which industry veterinarians would do well to serve. Stay tuned for possible positions in our future newsletters. Some of these require nomination from AAIV, but most do not require any group’s nomination. So please nominate yourself if you are interested in serving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twice a year, the entire House of Delegates meets for two days, and the allied groups start at 6:00 AM the first day. That day ends with the district meetings at about 8:00 PM or so. The second day is a bit shorter but still important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please send any comments or questions to AAIV at <a href="mailto:industryvet@gmail.com">industryvet@gmail.com</a>. As always, thank you for your support and we are here for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Carolyn Luther, D.V.M. – AAIV At Large Director</p>



<p>Things I can’t live without when I travel, Part 1: Personal care and travel items</p>



<p>I have been working in animal health for 12 years now, and some of these items have been with me almost as long!&nbsp; The biggest ”lifestyle” recommendation I have is to keep a carry-on suitcase that has everything you need for travel in it all the time, and then you only have to add clothes for each trip.</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png">


<p>Separate <a href="https://a.co/d/1XVuAdr">bathroom case</a> and smaller <a href="https://a.co/d/hrRTBv2">bedside stuff</a> case (including emergency meds) that live in my suitcase. My old ones (farewell ebags brand) aren’t around but these styles have worked well for many years for me.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/humangear-GoTo.png">


<p>Even though I do collect conditioner bottles from hotels, I gave into the hype and do prefer the&nbsp; <a href="https://a.co/d/iNEqAYC">HumanGear GoToob’</a>s – easy to refill, no leaks in 5-7 years of use – and color coded.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neck-pillow.png">


<p>Neck pillow – hangs on outside of suitcase so I don’t leave behind – I mainly actually use it as a lumbar support.&nbsp; For frequent long flights or when stuck with a middle seat, I love the <a href="https://a.co/d/9gy5Poz">trtl!</a>&nbsp; It props your head up so you can completely sleep and relax your neck without falling over – it is surprisingly effective – but a splurge item.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mini-garment-bag-insert.png">


<p>Mini garment bag insert: Mine came with an old suitcase, and you can just use a dry cleaning bag too, though mine has a padded piece in the middle to decrease wrinkles where you fold, and an extension longer than this picture –the important thing is that it safely folds up a suit jacket or dress clothes into my suitcase to control wrinkles.</p>



<p>(If you have to travel with suits for your meetings, consider a <a href="https://a.co/d/i05Gr2c">wheeled garment bag</a>, I can get everything I need in it – tightly – however the wide side wheel design means you can’t wheel it down the aisle inside the plane and mine when loaded was heavy).</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Carryon.png">


<p>Away bag:  I polled my friends on Facebook, and the Away brand won.  I do think it is better than my old TJ Maxx one – better wheels, less lost space, reliable zippers, handle long enough for my height, and since I switched to hard side I won’t go back – last week it weighed in loaded at 34lbs. My referral code for a $40 off: <a href="https://referrals.awaytravel.com/away732248">https://referrals.awaytravel.com/away732248</a> I got the “Bigger Carry On” and have been able to carry on all flights so far.</p>



<p>
</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sleep-mask.png">


<p>Sleep Mask:  My most recent addition comes from a discussion at a bar waiting for a train about what a terrible sleeper I am.  I never thought a sleep mask would be something I would want but now I use it every day at home and when traveling (in strange places I like to have a nightlight so I don’t wake up disoriented, this lets me have that and yet sleep in total darkness).  My advice is to order a few from Amazon and see what works best for you. <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">This is the one that fellow traveler recommended: Drowsy brand Silk mask</span>. This is<a href="https://a.co/d/5N8gl19"> the one that I kept</a> of the 5 I tested (doesn’t touch lashes, doesn’t grab hair, comfy for sleeping on side, light weight, no marks on face in am).</p>



<p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear AAIV Members,&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I write this newsletter, I can’t believe the start of school is only three weeks away for my son, who is an incoming freshman. His summer has been just as busy as the school year, filled with high school weight training, football and basketball practices, and an online summer school class. As we enter the latter half of summer, I find myself amidst the excitement and chaos of packing for a vacation. I am so looking forward to time away, but I understand all too well the busyness that surrounds preparing for and returning from a trip. Sometimes, the sheer volume of pre- and post-vacation tasks can make us reconsider the value of taking time off altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I want to emphasize how essential it is to push through that busyness and prioritize our well-being by stepping away from work. Recently, I heard a piece of advice that resonated deeply with me: do one thing each day to “take back your day.” This is a challenge that I’m taking on for the rest of the summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my own life, I’ve started incorporating small but meaningful activities that help me reconnect with myself and unwind:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Watering My Garden</strong>: Spending time (attempting to) nurture my plants not only brings me joy but also offers a peaceful break from daily stress.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Grounding with Bare Feet</strong>: Feeling the earth beneath my feet in my yard helps me feel centered and grounded.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Eating Lunch Outside</strong>: A change of scenery, fresh air and a moment of tranquility make a world of difference during a busy day. </li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Having a Glass of Wine with My Husband</strong>: This is a simple habit that helps me break away from work and shifts my focus back to my family.&nbsp;</li>

<strong>Playing Ball with My Dogs</strong>: Just a few minutes outside with my dogs usually brings me some laughs; it’s good for my dogs and gives me a refreshing break.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>These “take back my day” moments remind me of the importance of carving out time for myself amidst my busy schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking a vacation is an extended version of these daily practices. It allows us to truly disconnect from work, recharge and return with renewed energy and creativity. I know it’s hard for so many of us to turn the work emails off on our phones and not take our computers with us. I struggle with this and I don’t always succeed, but I have good intentions. </p>



<p>
<strong>Make Vacation a Priority!</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I encourage each of you to plan and prioritize your vacations. Whether it’s an elaborate trip or a simple staycation, the key is to disconnect and focus on activities that bring you joy and relaxation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Upcoming Events</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you plan your next getaway, don’t forget about the exciting events we have lined up:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>How to Break Into Non-Clinical Veterinary Jobs</strong>: Aug. 19, 2024, 6:00 p.m. CT</li>

<p>Taking time off is not just a luxury; it’s a necessity for maintaining our well-being and effectiveness in our careers. As I prepare for my own vacation, I hope you find inspiration to prioritize your personal time and reap the many benefits that come with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wishing you all a restful and enjoyable remainder of the summer!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warm regards,&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>By&nbsp;Timothy Smaha, D.V.M., AAIV Alternate Delegate to the AVMA HOD</strong>
</p>



<p>The 2024 AVMA convention was held in Austin, Texas, with the House of Delegates meeting on June 20-21. At the meeting, the House of Delegates was updated on the recent outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, heard from outgoing president and vice president, and welcomed the new officers – Dr. Sandra Faeh as President, Dr. Michael Bailey as President-Elect and Dr. Gary Marshall as Vice President.  Furthermore, the initial campaign was kicked off for President-Elect for 2025 with two candidates presenting to the HOD – Drs. Mary Ergen and Jennifer Quammen.</p>



<p>The HOD groups met in reference committees to discuss several resolutions/revisions and further discuss information gathered during the Veterinary Information Forum in January.</p>



<p>The approved resolutions included updates to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics, which occurs every five years. The changes included a code of conduct that comprises three sections:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Provide competent medical care</li>



<li>Prioritize patient welfare in balance with client needs and public safety</li>



<li>Uphold standards of professionalism.</li>
</ul>



<p>The second vote was to approve a new AVMA policy on the Transportation of Animals. Humane transport of animals should be evidence-based and address the animals handling, equipment, facilities, transport vehicles and must provide for safety of animals and personnel while minimizing stress, injury, and transmission of disease. This guidance was developed in collaboration with veterinarians, animal welfare scientists and transportation experts.</p>



<p>The final resolution was presented to recognize active duty and reserve military veterinarians of the uniformed services. The HOD consensus was that all branches of the uniformed service, including public health and NOAA officers, should be recognized. This resolution was adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Veterinary Information Forum topics discussed included professional liability insurance for veterinarians. This topic was referred to the Board of Directors to consider two actions. The first action was to investigate the development of reputation management (reputation defense) resources for members. The second action was to collaborate with AVMA PLIT to create an omnichannel approach to educate members on programs and issues related to liability.</p>



<p>Other discussions that will surely be revisited in January include updates to the Model Veterinary Practice Act, License portability (especially for mobile veterinarians or those who have practices in multiple states), and the use of technology and artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine.</p>



<p>There are several open positions on the AVMA Council on Therapeutics and Biologics. Interested members should consider application to the committee if qualifications are met. There also are several openings on committees including the Animal Welfare Committee, Veterinary Leadership Conference (VLC) planning committee and the Clinical Practitioners Advisory Committee (CPAC). Please visit <a href="https://www.avma.org/membership/volunteering-avma/avma-volunteer-opportunities-vacancies#council">AVMA Volunteer opportunities and open positions</a> for more information on how you can apply and get involved.</p>



<p>You can read about all of the topics and resolutions in the AVMA blog about the HOD meeting here: <a href="https://editor.ne16.com/vo/?FileID=4f212591-26d6-4f6a-8053-73340b6b69e9&amp;m=84904eef-35ba-4522-a491-fddf1ab41a71&amp;MailID=7234094&amp;listid=1003447&amp;RecipientID=10999238876&amp;utm_source=delivra&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=News%20Bulletin%2006.28.24&amp;utm_id=7234094&amp;dlv-emuid=84904eef-35ba-4522-a491-fddf1ab41a71&amp;dlv-mlid=7234094">AVMA Meeting recap</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear AAIV Members,</p>



<p>When I think of spring, I envision beauty, new opportunities and growth. It’s a season that inspires fresh perspectives and energizes us for what lies ahead. </p>



<p>I recently embarked on a new chapter, transitioning into a new role and organization. This experience reinforced the value of reflection and seizing new opportunities. For those considering a shift from clinical practice to an industry role or exploring new avenues within non-clinical practice, I encourage you to engage in a reflective exercise. Spend a few moments to take stock of your strengths, passions and career aspirations to ensure your next step aligns with your personal and professional goals.  Over the past few months, I’ve started my day by spending time in reflection and stillness.  It has helped me immensely in setting the tone for the day! If you are unsure of your next steps, don’t forget about our mentoring program.  You can request a mentor or sign up to be a mentor here: <a href="https://aaivet.org/mentoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aaivet.org/mentoring/</a>. </p>



<p>Looking ahead, we have two exciting events lined up to address common challenges faced by industry professionals. In May, join us for the <a href="https://aaivet.org/inspire_events/parents-who-travel-panel-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parents Who Travel Panel Discussion</a>, where our panel will delve into their strategies for balancing the demands of an industry job with family and pet responsibilities. This promises to be an enlightening discussion with practical insights from seasoned professionals who’ve successfully (and even at times, unsuccessfully) managed these challenges.&nbsp; We invite you to bring your questions and personal experiences.&nbsp; This is sure to be a great discussion!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, mark your calendars for our June webinar focused on <a href="https://aaivet.org/inspire_events/building-fences-developing-and-maintaining-boundaries-at-work-and-in-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">setting boundaries</a>. Whether it’s navigating workload expectations or finding harmony between work and personal life, setting clear boundaries is essential for overall well-being. This webinar aims to equip you with practical strategies to establish and maintain healthy boundaries in your professional journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we prepare for the upcoming AVMA Convention in Austin, Texas, I invite you to register for our <a href="https://aaivet.org/inspire_events/aaiv-networking-event-at-avma-convention-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">networking reception</a>. This event presents a fantastic opportunity to connect with fellow industry veterinarians, exchange ideas, and expand your professional network.  This is another great opportunity for those who aren’t quite sure what an industry role is.  Feel free to bring a friend who has expressed interest!  At the networking reception, attendees can look forward to enjoying coffee, tea and light breakfast pastries while engaging in lively conversations with experienced non-clinical veterinarians. Whether you’re seeking information about industry roles, exploring job opportunities, or looking to connect with potential candidates, this event provides the perfect setting to expand your professional network and gain valuable insights.  </p>



<p>Thank you for your continued support and participation in AAIV. Let’s embrace the opportunities for growth and collaboration this season brings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>By&nbsp;Debra Nickelson, D.V.M., MBA</strong>
</p>



<p>Your HOD delegates participated in a meeting with AVMA on March 1 to hear about the most recent legislation concerning xylazine. Here is a summary and more details directly from AVMA are below.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is a provision&nbsp;in newest legislation&nbsp;that the DEA cannot&nbsp;require manufacturers of xylazine to incur capital expenditures to meet DEA requirements of clinics.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Manufacturers will have one year to get labels changed and institute SOPs for xylazine</li>



<li>Labels will classify product as a schedule 3, non-narcotic</li>



<li>FDA and DEA will expedite all manufacturer&nbsp;submissions</li>



<li>Manufacturers&nbsp;may have to change distribution to 1-2 areas, decreasing&nbsp;the number of current distributors</li>
</ul>



<p>An updated version of the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act has become public. The updated language can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Combatting-Illict-Xylazine-Act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. The updated approach is the result of much effort and is now supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is currently the viable political pathway to address the problem of illicit xylazine while working to preserve the availability and current uses of the legitimate veterinary drug.</p>



<p>The updated approach seeks to address the unintended consequences of scheduling xylazine via a different approach than an exemption. This new approach is to schedule xylazine under the federal controlled substances act as a schedule III drug and make amendments to the controlled substances act to ensure the common uses of xylazine remain legal, as well as some additional provisions to help maintain the availability of the drug and track the legitimate supply. </p>



<p>
<em>&nbsp;From the AVMA:</em>
</p>



<p>On April 1, the AVMA sent a letter to Congressional leaders urging them to move quickly to enact this approach. It is the right balance between empowering law enforcement to combat illicit xylazine while maintaining the legitimate veterinary uses. </p>



<p>
<strong>What does the new approach do?</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Xylazine would be scheduled under the federal controlled substances act as a schedule III drug.</li>



<li>For xylazine only, it would expand the definition of “ultimate user” under the federal controlled substances act<ul>
<li>The current definition of ultimate user under the federal controlled substances act limits the prescribing or dispensing of controlled substances by a veterinarian to a person “for an animal owned by him or by a member of his household.”&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition does not work for many of the uses of xylazine.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For xylazine only, the bill would amend the definition of ultimate user to allow appropriate prescribing or dispensing of xylazine as a controlled drug for possession by a person for:<ul>
<li>&nbsp;An animal owned by them or a member of their household;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An animal under their care;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use in government animal control programs;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use in wildlife programs authorized by law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For xylazine, the term “person” includes: a government agency or business where animals are located, and an employee or agent of an agency or business acting within the scope of their employment or agency.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The updated definition of ultimate user for xylazine is intended to allow the current legitimate uses of xylazine to continue.</li>



<li>In order to help facilitate the ongoing commercial availability of the legitimate supply of xylazine the bill includes provisions to:<ul>
<li>Ensure that current manufacturers of FDA-approved xylazine do not have to make capital expenditures to their facilities for the purpose of continuing to manufacture xylazine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provide a one-year transition period for the requirements related to labeling, packaging, and distribution logistics.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Require the FDA and DEA to facilitate and expedite any required manufacturer applications and submissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Veterinarians that utilize xylazine in their practice and are not already registered with the DEA, would have 60 days after enactment to apply for DEA practitioner registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;A practitioner that has applied for registration during this period may continue their lawful activities until such application is approved or denied.</li>



<li>Veterinarians that maintain an inventory of xylazine would have 60 days after enactment to comply with the record keeping and inventory requirements for a schedule III drug.</li>



<li>The bill would require manufacturers and distributors (not veterinarians) to report product sales and movement through the DEA Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;ARCOS is an automated, comprehensive drug reporting system which monitors the flow of DEA controlled substances from their point of manufacture through commercial distribution channels.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Why does the AVMA support this new approach?</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It will provide law enforcement with tools to interdict illicit xylazine.</li>



<li>It contains many provisions to increase the likelihood of maintaining the commercial availability of the legitimate supply of xylazine for use in veterinary practice.</li>



<li>It addresses the vast majority of the unintended consequences of scheduling xylazine.</li>



<li>It is the politically viable approach.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The AVMA has worked very closely with AABP and AAEP, as well as the zoo, wildlife and research groups, to ensure the approach works for the most critical uses of xylazine in veterinary medicine.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Will the AVMA provide additional information?</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If the updated Combating Illicit Xylazine language is enacted, the AVMA will undertake an educational outreach effort to ensure that veterinarians who utilize and have inventories of xylazine understand their obligations during the transition period.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Ann Korbel, D.V.M. – AAIV President-Elect</p>



<p>When I made the transition from general veterinary practice to industry, I became a road warrior. Over the years I’ve developed a long list of travel essentials, but today I’d like to share a fun one. I never leave home – for work or for play – without a Turkish cotton towel.</p>



<p>You might be wondering, “Why?” Let me share with you all the reasons I love these cozy little marvels. First, I am one of those people who always feels cold. My Turkish cotton towel is pretty enough to pass as a scarf or shawl in a chilly conference room and warm enough to serve as a blanket on an airplane or in a hotel room. It also rolls up into a comfy neck rest if I need to catch a few ZZZs on the plane.</p>



<p>My towel is incredibly absorbent, rinses easily and dries super fast. Airplane turbulence spilled your drink? Those tiny cocktail napkins aren’t going to help, but a corner of my towel wipes everything up in a flash. Have you or your equipment ever been rained on during an outdoor event? My towel is right there to the rescue. I can toss it over a car seat and it will be dry in a few hours.</p>



<p>Finally, my towel works great as, well, a towel. Hotel service ever forgot to restock your room? No worries – you brought your own towel! I purchased my very first Turkish cotton towel for a beach vacation. It didn’t disappoint. It shed sand much better than regular beach towels. It also made a comfy seat cover and/or pretty table cloth when the cleanliness of the only available park bench was questionable.</p>



<p>A quick Google search will introduce you to many companies that sell Turkish cotton towels. I’ve purchased most of mine from <a href="https://teema.co/">Teema</a> because I’m fond of their neutral patterns and color schemes. Try one and I’m sure you’ll find as many unique uses for it as I have.</p>



<p>Do you have a “must have?” If so, we would love to hear about it! Email us at <a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>By Jennifer Kasten, D.V.M.</p>



<p>Industry veterinarians are busy people. For most of us, our days are filled spent in airports or driving down highways, attending dinners that extend late into the night, sleeping in hotel rooms and squeezing in email and admin time wherever we can get it. Our office-based colleagues frequently spend their time in front of multiple screens, where meetings and phone calls tend to dominate their time. Each of us has a few products or items that help us get through our days just a little bit more comfortably and easily.</p>



<p>With that in mind, AAIV is starting a new series in our newsletter: “My Must Have.” Quarterly, one AAIV Board Member will highlight a product that they simply can’t live without or makes their day-to-day much more manageable. Whenever possible, we will include links to the product so you can get it for yourself.</p>



<p>As your vice president for external communication, I will kick us off with the <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/73882?page=personal-organizer-toiletry-bag-medium&amp;csp=a&amp;feat=73889-recsbottom.pdp&amp;ri=rbpIFI2&amp;pos=2&amp;attrValue_0=Crisp%20Lapis">L.L. Bean Personal Organizer Toiletry Bag</a>.</p>



<p>I first acquired this bag in 2014 before an extended backpacking trip in Europe, 18 months before I became an industry veterinarian. I liked it then because it seemed to have a pocket and place for everything, including a little caddy to take into the shower. Zippered pockets kept my mini pharmacy clean and away from my toothbrush and razor. Similarly, I fit my makeup into one of the side pockets and brushes in the other. The center compartment has plenty of room for the TSA-approved 1-quart plastic bag for liquids. The hook is handy for hanging in hotel bathrooms (there is always<em> somewhere</em> to hang it), which makes accessing things very simple. The handle on the top makes it easy to carry. The medium-sized bag fits nicely in my roller board suitcase. I also can get it into a backpack or tote bag, if needed.</p>



<p>Since that first trip to Europe 10 years ago, my toiletry bag has traveled over 400,000 miles on airlines, survived countless road trips, and been hung up in more hotel rooms than I care to think about. It has held up perfectly for all of it and looks as good as the day I bought it. I take tremendous pride in <a href="https://aaivet.org/mentoring/">mentoring</a> aspiring industry veterinarians. Whenever one of my mentees lands their first position, I send them one of these toiletry bags. At the very affordable price of just $35, it makes an easy “welcome to industry” gift for field veterinarians. For all these reasons, this bag is my “must have!”</p>



<p>Do you have a “must have?” If so, we would love to <a href="industryvets@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hea</a>
<a>r</a> about it!</p>

<p>
<strong>AAIV Delegate</strong>
</p>



<p>The House of Delegates for the AVMA met during the Veterinary Leadership Symposium early January in Chicago. For once it was rather nice outside! The American Association of Industry Veterinarians is represented by myself and Dr. Tim Smaha. Please send any comments or questions to AAIV at <a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>. As always, thank you for your support and we are here for you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Candidates and Elections</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dr. Michael Q. Bailey is running unopposed for AVMA President-Elect 2024-2025</li>



<li>Dr. Gary Marshall is running unopposed for AVMA Vice President 2024-2026</li>



<li>These individuals were elected due to running unopposed:<ul>
<li>Dr. Bridget Eichos – Council on Public Health</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Lloyd Reitz – Council on Research, private practice</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Jessica Fox – Council on Veterinary Service, private mixed practice</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dr. Kristin Haas – Council on Public Health</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Resolutions</strong>
</p>



<p>There were six resolutions brought forward to the House of Delegates for review. Such resolutions are brought to the House if a new policy is created, an existing policy needs rewording or if the Board of Directors determines the policy to be pertinent. The official AVMA summary is <a href="https://www.avma.org/news/delegates-update-avma-policies-diets-cats-and-dogs-animal-loss-support-services">Delegates update AVMA policies on diets for cats and dogs, animal loss support services | American Veterinary Medical Association</a> but my summary follows.</p>



<p>A new policy on <strong>Mitigating Hazards in the Veterinary Workplace</strong> was referred back to the Board of Directors. The goal was to combine the policy on Guidelines for Addressing Hazards in the Workplace and the policy on Veterinary Facility Occupational Risks for Pregnant Workers. It was determined that the wording in this combination needed more work.</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Safe Non-Commercial Transport of Pets in Motor Vehicles</strong> passed after some minor amendments. There was much discussion about different cultures, economic challenges, services animals, etc. but it was determined that this is a statement and&nbsp; recommendation, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Dog and Cat Population Management</strong> passed after four amendments. This resolution stressed the need for awareness and education to reduce relinquishment, the importance of sterilization of privately owned dogs and cats, preventing unrestricted or unsupervised outdoor access, preventing or managing behavior issues and how to keep pets in the home. And appropriate veterinary care, of course.</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Safety Testing</strong> was passed to emphasize the need to refine, reduce and replace live animals in research.</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Raw or Undercooked Animal-Source Protein in Dog and Cat Diets</strong> passed. It emphasizes that alternative methods that reduce or eliminate the risk of illness due to pathogenic contaminants may be considered. This does not include the feeding of unpasteurized, same-species milk to nursing young.</p>



<p>A revised policy on <strong>Animal Loss Support Groups</strong> passed so the AVMA backs support services for people anticipating or dealing with the loss of animals. The AVMA needs to continue its efforts to address the psychological impacts of humane endings.</p>



<p>
<strong>Other Topics</strong>
</p>



<p>The AVMA is seeking comments on the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics and Model Veterinary Practice Act until March 4, 2024</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>President’s Perspective</strong>
</p>



<p>Dear AAIV Members,</p>



<p>As we step into the promise of a new year, I am honored to serve as the President of the AAIV. Winter invites us to reflect and set intentions for the coming year, and I invite each of you to join me on this journey.</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, we celebrate significant milestones and achievements. The inclusion of veterinary technicians as affiliate members has expanded our community, bringing diverse expertise to enrich AAIV. Our mentorship program successfully matched 21 mentors and mentees, fostering professional growth within our community. Hosting four webinars, which were free for members, and organizing two in-person and one virtual networking reception kept us connected and informed.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to 2024, we’ve already made strides. Our recent in-person networking reception at VMX broke attendance records, marking a successful turnout. We hosted the AAIV Learning and Leadership Program,&nbsp;featuring knowledgeable speakers offering insights and advice for those interested in industry roles or those seeking professional development.</p>



<p>Excitingly, our <a href="https://secure.aaivet.org/nx/portal/neonevents/events#/events/1207">webinar series kicks off on March 18</a> and continues to be free for members. This year, we also will introduce practical virtual and in-person roundtables tailored to the interests of industry veterinarians. Keep an eye out for our upcoming compensation survey, providing valuable insights from colleagues nationwide. Our next in-person networking reception is scheduled for AVMA, with details on our next virtual reception coming soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I extend my gratitude to the outgoing board and our past president, Dr. Allison Sateren, for their dedicated service. Their efforts have laid a robust foundation for the exciting developments that lie ahead.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t already, I encourage you to <a href="https://secure.aaivet.org/forms/membership">sign up for AAIV membership</a> and unlock the benefits it offers—connections with like-minded professionals, staying informed about industry trends, mentorship opportunities and exclusive educational content.</p>



<p>Let’s make 2024 a year of growth and collaboration. Together, we can create an environment where each member THRIVES in their career. Visit <a href="https://aaivet.org/">our website</a> to sign up for membership and explore the full spectrum of benefits that AAIV has to offer.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of collective success and individual achievements!</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>



<img src="https://aaivet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AAIV_Sponsorship-Package-2024.jpg">



<p>Bianca Zenor, D.V.M. M.S.<br>AAIV President </p>

<![CDATA[<p>We have a new face in the AAIV world! Isabella “Izzy” Ramirez will be taking over the role of AAIV coordinator in the new year. Izzy comes from an administrative assistant and customer service background, previously holding roles at FosterAdopt Connect and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in Kansas City, KS. As many of you know, AAIV has a partnership with K-State Olathe in which we help each other serve those in the animal health industry. An integral part of this partnership is the role of the coordinator who assists with administrative, marketing and members services duties for our organization. Megan Gould, the AAIV coordinator since November 2020, will be stepping into more responsibilities on the marketing team at K-State Olathe and is handing the reins over to Izzy. We appreciate Megan’s dedication throughout her time with our organization and are happy to continue working with K-State Olathe!

<![CDATA[<p>AAIV’s sponsor, Total Planning, would like to share some frequently asked questions. Make sure to mention you are an AAIV member as members receive a discount!</p>



<p>
<strong>What is Disability Income insurance?</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s a financial safety net that helps replace a portion of your income if a serious illness or injury prevents</p>



<p>you from working.</p>



<p>
<strong>How does Disability Income insurance work?</strong>
</p>



<p>You make scheduled payments just like you do with other types of insurance. Then, if you ever get a</p>



<p>serious illness or injury that prevents you from working, you receive a monthly benefit that helps you pay everyday living expenses. Think of this insurance as protection for your income (disability insurance is sometimes known as “income protection”).</p>



<p>
<strong>How much does Disability Income insurance cost?</strong>
</p>



<p>It depends on a few factors, such as your income and age.</p>



<p>
<strong>Why is Disability Income insurance important?</strong>
</p>



<p>Your income is your financial foundation. It pays for immediate needs, like groceries and your mortgage or rent, and it helps you save for the future. That’s why protecting it in the event of a disability is so vital.</p>



<p>Disabilities are more common than you might think. The word “disability” may make you think of accidents, like back injuries or severe falls. But most disabilities come in the form of common, long-term illnesses, like cancer or Parkinson’s disease.</p>



<p>
<strong>Supplement what you have through work.</strong>
</p>



<p>Already have disability insurance through your employer? That’s a good start. But it typically only covers</p>



<p>about 60% of your income—also when you leave a job, that coverage doesn’t come with you. Individual</p>



<p>Disability Income insurance can help protect more of your income, and it’s 100% yours.</p>



<p>
<strong>Focus on healing.</strong>
</p>



<p>No one wants to think about getting too sick or hurt to work. But if it happens, Disability Income insurance lets you worry less about your finances, so you can focus on getting better.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>President’s Perspective</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s hard to believe that the holiday season is upon us. Where did the time go, and when will I find the time for a little holiday shopping? I wanted to open this letter by congratulating the 2023 board on their accomplishments this year. I truly appreciate your hard work and patience along the way. It’s great to see the progress and continued success of the organization. A big congratulations and welcome are in order for the new 2024 board. This year we welcome Dr. Diane McDonald from Merck Animal Health as a new at-large director. We’re excited to have you, Diane!</p>



<p>This month marks my last month as president. In January, I will turn the presidency over to Dr. Bianca Zenor, a respected colleague, fellow mom and friend. I cannot imagine a more talented and insightful individual to lead our organization in 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to VMX? We invite you to our first ever morning coffee networking reception! Mark your calendars for 7:30 – 9 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 14, in Celebration Room 13 in the Hyatt. Stop by for some light breakfast items, morning coffee and most importantly, the opportunity to network with your current and future industry veterinarian colleagues. It is a great way to meet new veterinarians and technicians excited to explore industry opportunities and connect with old friends.</p>



<p>Additionally, we will be hosting the Learning and Leadership track as always. All day on Saturday, industry experts will speak on topics such as how to break into non-clinical veterinary jobs and how to connect with difficult people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, I want to thank YOU — the members! We couldn’t do what we do without your continued support and interest in our programming and industry. I hope you all have a safe, healthy and happy holiday season. We’ll see you in 2024!</p>



<p>Warmest regards,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>By&nbsp;Debra Nickelson</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>The Major Resolution</strong>
</p>



<p>There were nine resolutions brought forward to the House of Delegates for review during the summer session in July. Such resolutions are brought to the House if a new policy is created, an existing policy needs rewording or if the Board of Directors determines the policy to be pertinent.</p>



<p>A new policy on safeguarding care for animals with veterinary-led teams passed in that the AVMA will vigorously defend the practice of veterinary medicine against the scope of practice expansions by non-veterinarians. Basically, this policy is against proposals for a mid-level professional and urges full use of veterinary technicians in conjunction with the veterinary team.</p>



<p>This is the full verbiage of the resolution: <br>“Safeguarding Care for Animals with Veterinarian-Led Teams Animals deserve safe, efficacious, and high-quality care, and animal owners should be able to fully trust the veterinary services provided for them. Accordingly, the AVMA will vigorously defend the practice of veterinary medicine—which includes the ability to diagnose, prognose, develop treatment plans, prescribe, and/or perform surgery—against scope of practice expansions by non-veterinarians that threaten patient health and safety, the safety of animal products, and/or public health. Veterinary healthcare is enhanced through efficient utilization of each member of the team through appropriate delegation of tasks and responsibilities by the veterinarian.” (<a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/safeguarding-care-animals-veterinarian-led-teams">AVMA</a>)</p>



<p>This following appeared in a recent issue of Brakke report: <br>“The Coalition for the Veterinary Professional Associate (CVPA) – a nonprofit association with over 32 expert veterinary professionals representing a wide variety of stakeholders in their respective fields nationwide – announced the advancement of the Veterinary Professional Associate (VPA) position. This will be an accredited and licensed new role that will directly address the call related to the existing national veterinary provider shortage in support of rural and companion animal needs with access to care.”<em> (</em>

<em>EINnews</em>
</a>
<em>)</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Other Resolutions</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A revised policy on <strong>Canine Devocalization</strong> discouraged convenience devocalization as a nontherapeutic procedure that negatively impacts the welfare of the dog.</li>



<li>A revised policy on <strong>Docking of Lamb’s Tails</strong> passed with AVMA opposing excessively short tail docking.</li>



<li>A revised policy on <strong>Tail Docking of Cattle</strong> passed which added that the veterinarian use procedures and practices that reduce or eliminate pain and distress, including the use of AMDUCA permissible clinically effective medications.</li>



<li>A new policy on <strong>Sheep and Goat Castration</strong> was referred back to the Animal Welfare Committee for revisions on recommended ages.</li>



<li>A new policy on <strong>Sheep and Goat Disbudding and Dehorning</strong> was referred back to the Animal Welfare Committee for more clarification on recommended ages and the fact that these procedures usually do not apply to sheep.</li>



<li>A revised policy on <strong>Physical Restraint of Animals</strong> passed after being carefully amended to cover physical handling and/or restraint, minimizing fear, pain, distress, and suffering and protecting people from harm.</li>



<li>A new policy on <strong>Canine Hybrids</strong> passed after amendments to cover offspring of such hybrids. This policy eliminated language that encouraged the development of drugs and vaccines for use in canine hybrids.</li>



<li>A resolution called <strong>“Statement to the Profession”</strong> says that the AVMA recognizes the importance of public practice to the entire veterinary community, supports efforts for recruitment and retention benefits from increased Congressional funding for all federal agencies’ incentive programs, removal of the annual salary cap in declared emergency disease outbreaks, student loan repayment bonuses and other incentives the agency deems appropriate to encourage more veterinarians to enter and remain in public practice.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Veterinary Information Forum Topics</strong>
<br>–<strong>Spectrum of Care</strong>
</p>



<p>The House of Delegates agreed that applying a spectrum of care helps to address the problem of affordability of veterinary care by offering a range of acceptable care options that are evidence -based while remaining responsive to client expectations and financial and other resource limitations.</p>



<p>–<strong>Sustainability in Veterinary Medicine: The Greening of Veterinary Workplaces</strong>
</p>



<p>The House of Delegates recognized One Health – the intersection of human health, animal health, and ecosystem health. We can promote sustainability across our profession by applying eco principles and being thoughtful on how we use resources.</p>



<p>Again, it is our honor to represent you, not just during the HOD sessions, but all year. AAIV thanks Dr. Ellen Lowery for representing you during the last four years and mentoring me in the House of Delegates. We welcome Dr. Tim Smaha as your new alternate delegate, who will join me on the house floor at the Veterinary Leadership Conference this January. Please let us know what questions and concerns you have via <a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<strong>President’s Perspective</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s fall, y’all! I don’t know about you, but I am enjoying the little bit of cooler weather and college football. Our recent virtual networking event was the perfect event to kick off the season. Not only did we have a chance to see some new faces interested in learning more about AAIV, it was also a chance to connect with other colleagues and friends.</p>



<p>So, what’s new at AAIV? Well, it’s October and that means we have two main focus areas for the rest of the year. First off, board elections are right around the corner. Do you have interest in serving on our board? Do you know someone who would be a good fit? We are accepting applications until Oct. 17 for the positions of President-Elect, Vice President of Marketing and External Communications, Vice President of Internal Communications, and one Board Member position. Check out the website or reach out to us for more information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, be on the lookout for the link to complete the compensation survey. Last year, we started to incorporate changes that were suggested by our platinum sponsors. Whether it’s an initial curiosity about industry itself or a potential new job role, the data gathered serves as a great resource for members. The more people who complete the survey, the stronger the data!</p>



<p>As we look towards 2024, don’t forget that we have one last webinar this year, and then we’ll be back with an exciting new lineup in the new year. All webinars are free for members and RACE-approved, so take advantage! Continue reading the articles in the newsletter for more ways to take advantage of your membership. </p>



<p>Cheers to fall,</p>

<strong>President’s Perspective</strong>
</p>



<p>If you know me personally, you know I am a creature of habit. I wake up at the same time each day; I park in the same parking lot at the airport; and I paddle board the same route each time I get out on the water. Yes, guilty as charged.</p>



<p>However, I have been told time and time again that change is good and a part of growing. The current board of directors has certainly embraced that change. For starters, as a board, we agreed on increasing member dues. The last increase in dues was nearly a decade ago and was long overdue. There was so much thought and consideration that went into making this decision to ensure that the amount is still very reasonable and consistent with other allied organizations. We also advocated for a new membership type: affiliate membership. We recognized that now is the right time to embrace our industry veterinary technicians and we are excited for this new beginning together. Lastly, we updated our website and host server, and added an additional member benefit thanks to our new partner Total Planning. More to come on that soon! Together, as an organization, we are embracing change for the sake of the veterinary community that we serve.</p>



<p>One last push for this season: Remind other industry veterinarians and technicians out there about the benefits of an AAIV membership. Looking for way to get involved? Jump on one of our webinars and share or comment on our social media. Need a mentor or want to become one? Join our mentorship program. Does sponsorship interest you? Reach out to us. Finally, as always, this is YOUR organization, and we want to hear from YOU!</p>



<p>Enjoy the warmer weather. Happy Summer!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dr. Collins presented a webinar about how people of any generation can effectively engage and interact with people of other generations in the workplace. She showed some examples of general perceptions regarding each generation and shared that people often compare the next generation coming up as not fitting their familiar mold.</p>



<p>These generation categories include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Silent</li>



<li>Baby Boomers</li>



<li>Gen X</li>



<li>Millennials</li>



<li>Gen Z </li>
</ul>



<p>“Cuspers” are those who were born three to five years between generations.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that everyone is unique, and no one fits a standard mold. Here are some ideas to communicate between generations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Talk to the other generations to find out what is important to them and why.</li>



<li>Appreciate the differences and use the strengths of each generation.</li>



<li>Learn how people prefer communications and how they prefer to obtain their information.</li>



<li>Give feedback as needed and desired.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>AVMA endorses federal legislation to address illicit xylazine</strong>
</p>



<p>A newly proposed law backed by the AVMA would help combat the emerging threat posed by illicit xylazine while protecting veterinary access to this important animal sedative. The Combating Illicit Xylazine Act was introduced into congress in March. The bill’s provisions would equip law enforcement with additional tools to stop xylazine trafficking while maintaining veterinarians’ ability to legitimately use xylazine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It strikes the right balance of protecting our communities while preserving veterinary access to this critically important animal drug. If it becomes law, the legislation will make the manufacture, distribution, dispensing or possession of illicit xylazine subject to Schedule III penalties under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Illicit use of xylazine includes any use, or intended use, in people and would address any diversion of xylazine from veterinary sources. At the same time,&nbsp;<strong>the legitimate veterinary uses would remain under their current prescription status</strong>.</p>



<p>
<strong>Highlights of the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of illicit xylazine would be subject to Schedule III penalties, engaging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and allowing for harsher punishments when xylazine is handled illegally.</li>



<li>The legitimate importation, manufacture, dispensing and administration of xylazine for non-human species would not be subject to the restrictions and requirements of scheduling. </li>



<li>Any diversion of xylazine from the veterinary supply chain for illicit use would be subject to the penalties of a Schedule III drug.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Manufacturers and distributors would report sales of veterinary xylazine to the DEA through a tracking system that would identify unusual activity or changes in ordering patterns.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The DEA would submit a report to congress detailing the prevalence and impacts of illicit xylazine use in the United States.&nbsp;</li>

<![CDATA[<p>It was an absolute pleasure to have so many of you join us in Orlando for the 2023 Veterinary Meeting and Expo! Our time together began on Saturday with the Learning and Leadership Continuing Education Track, an AAIV and K-State Olathe sponsored program, which featured a lineup of knowledgeable speakers sharing insights and advice helpful in the veterinary profession.</p>



<p>The following day, the board of directors convened for their first meeting of the year. They deliberated on ways to enhance the value for AAIV members and considered potential new programs and improvements to existing ones.</p>



<p>Our networking reception on Monday was also a great success, where we heard from AAIV President, Allison Sateren. Allison shared updates on what we accomplished in 2022 and our plans for 2023, which includes more industry-focused webinars, in-person and virtual networking receptions, a new website set to launch in early March and compensation data that will be published soon for members to view.</p>



<p>We want to extend a big thank you to all of those who visited the AAIV booth, attended the networking reception and remain active members of our organization. We value your support and engagement!</p>

</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>February 2023</p>



<p>Resolutions</p>



<p>There were nine resolutions brought forward to the House of Delegates for review during the winter session in January. Such resolutions are brought to the House if a new policy is created, an existing policy needs rewording or if the board of directors determines the policy to be pertinent.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An updated policy on “Inherited Disorders in Responsible Breeding of Companion Animals” that supersedes the existing policy of the same name and continues to emphasize the importance of responsibly managing inherited disorders in companion animals.</li>
<li>A new policy on “Therapeutic Medications in Competition Equids” that supersedes the policy on “Therapeutic Medications in Non-racing Performance Horses,” mirroring revisions by the American Association of Equine Practitioners to the AAEP policy on this topic in 2020.</li>
<li>A new policy on “Unregulated Horse Racing” stating that the AVMA condemns unregulated racing of equids because of threats to animal health and welfare, such as infectious disease, administration of illegal substances and abusive practices.</li>
<li>New policies on “Bovine Disbudding and Dehorning” and “Bovine Castration” that supersede the policy on “Castration and Dehorning of Cattle” to recognize that castration and dehorning require different animal care and to clarify the distinction between dehorning and disbudding.</li>
<li>A consolidated policy titled “Harmonized Approach to Voluntary and Regulated Aquatic Animal Health Programs” that supersedes four policies on state oversight and federal programs pertaining to the health of aquatic animals.</li>
<li>A consolidated policy on “Veterinary Compounding” that supersedes the three existing policies on this topic, provides additional clarity and adds more resources.</li>
<li>A revised policy on “The Importance of Veterinarians in Food Safety” that adds a statement that management and leadership training would help improve the supervisory success, job satisfaction and retention of supervisory public health veterinarians with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service.</li>
<li>A revised policy on “Dog Bite Prevention” that adds a statement that all dogs can bite and reaffirms that the AVMA considers it inappropriate to label specific breeds or classes of dogs as aggressive or dangerous, among other revisions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The HOD did not approve a revised policy on “The Veterinarian’s Role in Supporting Appropriate Selection and Use of Service, Assistance, Emotional Support and Therapy Animals.” The proposed revisions were largely editorial. The HOD referred the revised policy back to the board of directors for clarification of the wording by the AVMA Steering Committee on Human-Animal Interactions.</p>



<p>Veterinary Information Forum Topics</p>



<p>
<em>Need for a mid-level position</em>
</p>



<p>The House of Delegates agreed that establishing a mid-level veterinary provider category would be complicated and would not do much to expand access to veterinary care. Instead, delegates agreed that the focus should be on improving resources and programs to retain veterinarians and veterinary technicians, further developing veterinary technician specialties and helping veterinary practices maximize efficiency.

</p>



<p>
<em>Workplace culture and retention</em>
</p>



<p>There are many relevant AVMA resources available, and the House of Delegates wants to make sure that members are aware of what is available and how to make use of them. Resources include:</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workplace Wellbeing Certificate program</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave Space Certificate program</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Train the Trainer program</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journey for Teams</p>



<p>There are also tools such as EAP programs and mental health coverage that exists within the offerings from the AVMA Trust.

</p>



<p>Thinking ahead to the summer session, one of these candidates will be elected AVMA president-elect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>President’s Perspective</strong>
</p>



<p>I am in complete disbelief that I am saying this but welcome to 2023. VMX marked my first official meeting as president.&nbsp;As a 15-plus year member of AAIV, three years on the board and more than 18 years of industry experience, I have a passion for this organization and can’t wait to get started.</p>



<p>However, first, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our 2022 AAIV board.&nbsp;All 14 members worked really hard to make 2022 a huge success.&nbsp;I would be remiss if I didn’t personally thank my mentor and friend, Dr. Tim Smaha, for his leadership last year. From sponsorship enhancement to a revamp of the compensation survey and everything in between, his direction took AAIV to the next level.&nbsp;Also, a big shoutout and a thank you to our fabulous 2022 sponsors. We know that sponsorship budgets are tightening each year for many companies. We appreciate your willingness to invest in your people and support our organization.</p>



<p>My message is simple this quarter. Spread the word about AAIV! There are so many practitioners looking to take the leap into our world and AAIV has so much to offer. For those veterinarians in industry who haven’t joined AAIV, remind them that AAIV is their voice with the AVMA, the place to meet and connect with fellow industry vets and a great resource for learning about compensation and additional career opportunities within the field. Finally, we want to hear from you. What are we doing well? How can we improve the organization?</p>



<p>I am honored to serve as your president and I look forward to another great year.</p>



<p>Warmest regards,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By: Stacy Pursell</p>



<p>Why It’s Smart to Be Open to Opportunity in Your Career</p>



<p>The way in which you view opportunity is the number one factor in ultimately determining how successful you will be in your animal health career.</p>



<p>That may sound like a rather bold statement, but I can say with confidence that it’s based upon my experience as an executive recruiter and search consultant for the past twenty-five years. I’ve worked with thousands of job seekers and candidates during that time and how they handled opportunity had a direct impact on their career growth, and in many cases, their career satisfaction.</p>



<p>So, how should you view opportunity?</p>



<p>First and foremost, it is a good idea to view an opportunity as an opportunity and not strictly as a risk. Everything in life is risky to some degree. You can’t escape it. In many cases, the greater the opportunity, the greater the risk. This is why you can’t “play it safe” all the time. If you do, then you increase the chances that you’ll get stuck in a “career rut,” and once you’re in one of those, it’s more difficult to escape than you might realize.</p>



<p>There are three distinct stages involved with approaching an opportunity in the correct way.</p>



<p>Stage #1—Being open to hearing about an opportunity</p>



<p>You can’t take advantage of an opportunity unless you know what that opportunity is, and to know what it is, you have to hear about it. This is an important first step because I sometimes encounter professionals who don’t even want to hear about an opportunity when one is presented to them. They say “no” before they even know what they’re saying “no” to.</p>



<p>One of the most successful people I know within the animal health industry told me that early in his career, his mentor instructed him countless times to never say “no” to an opportunity without first knowing about the opportunity. His mentor told him to always be open to at least hearing about the opportunity and that it costs you nothing to listen.</p>



<p>Stage #2—Being open to considering the opportunity</p>



<p>Once you hear about an opportunity, you must be open to considering it, especially if it’s clearly better than your current job. This means thoughtfully comparing and contrasting the opportunity with your current position and evaluating each in an objective fashion. Will the new opportunity help advance your career more than staying in your current job? If so, how will it? Or will staying in your current job help you to advance your career? Once again, if so, then why would that be the case?</p>



<p>Stage #3—Being open to exploring the opportunity</p>



<p>If you come to the conclusion that the opportunity is clearly better than your current job and does have the potential to advance your career, then you must be open to exploring it. And by “exploring,” I mean being willing to enter the hiring process of the organization that has the open position. Remember: just because you’re interviewing with another employer does not mean that you’re disloyal. It just means that you’re exploring your options. At the end of the process, you can always make the decision to stay at your current employer.</p>



<p>However, consider this: people who change jobs every three to five years earn more in compensation and benefits than people who stay at the same employer for ten to fifteen years. Why is that? Because employers must entice professionals they want to hire with more money, compensation and other benefits. And there are people in the job market who are changing jobs more frequently than every three to five years. In fact, they’re changing jobs every eighteen months to two years, and they’re not being labeled as a “job hopper,” either.</p>



<p>According to an article on the Forbes.com website, “staying employed at the same company for more than two years on average is going to make you earn less over your lifetime by about 50% or more.” The article also indicates that 50% is at the lowest end of the spectrum, with the potential for the percentage to be even higher. Not only that, but the numbers are only based on the assumption that a person’s career is going to last ten years. Consequently, the longer you work, the greater the difference in income will be over your lifetime.</p>



<p>While the Forbes.com article was published in 2014, it’s even more applicable now. The year 2014 was before there was a shortage of talent in the job market. It was before the “Great Resignation” and the virtual elimination of the job hopping stigma. In short, the passage of time has made “50% or more” far too conservative of a number. Market conditions have driven the dynamics involved to a fever pitch, ramping up the pace, the frequency and the severity of the factors contributing to the difference in income between people who change jobs frequently and those who do not.</p>



<p>This is why it’s a smart idea to be open to opportunity in your career — hearing about it, considering it and exploring it when it makes sense to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All you’re really doing is creating options for yourself. At no point during the process, especially during the initial stages, are you saying, “Yes, I will resign from my current employer and leave tomorrow to take another position.” First, there is no reason to resign your current job until another organization extends an offer of employment to you. Second, even if another organization extends an offer, you can always turn it down.</p>



<p>There are a number of factors that influence the amount of professional success that you’ll enjoy — your education, your skills, your experience, etc. However, as important as they, you can’t truly maximize your career with these things alone.</p>



<p>To truly maximize your career, you must have a healthy attitude about opportunity, you must approach it the right way and you must recognize and take advantage of those opportunities that have the potential to truly change your life in a positive way.</p>

<p>
<strong>AAALAC: What is it and Why are We a Member Org</strong>
</p>



<p>The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International) is a private, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of all animals in biomedical and agricultural research through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. Species covered include all laboratory animals as well as farm and agricultural animals. Currently, more than 1,050 companies, universities, hospitals, government agencies and other research institutions in 50 countries and regions have earned AAALAC accreditation. Accreditation of an organization demonstrates their commitment to responsible animal care and improvement in animal welfare and standards of care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does it take to become an accredited?</p>



<p>Along with meeting all applicable local and national regulations, AAALAC accredited institutions also must demonstrate that they are achieving the standards outlined in three primary standard documents, including the&nbsp;<em>Guide for the Care&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Use of Laboratory Animals</em>. Meeting these standards demonstrates that an organization goes above and beyond what is required by animal welfare regulations. After an institution earns accreditation, it must be re-evaluated every three years to maintain its accredited status. AAALAC participation is voluntary, and as such, AAALAC International is not a regulatory body. All information regarding the institutions and AAALAC are held confidentially.</p>



<p>AAIV as a member organization</p>



<p>AAIV is among a select group of professional and educational groups with an interest in advancing animal well-being in science and education and a commitment to the responsible and humane use of animals in science as a member organization. As part of this membership, AAIV appoints a representative to serve as an AAALAC International Member Organization Delegate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AAIV Delegate to AAALAC</p>



<p>Dr. Hilton Klein has been active with AAALAC since 1987 initially serving as a council on accreditation member. He became a member of AAALAC’s Board of Trustees in 2001 representing AAIV. He served as president of the board of directors.&nbsp;Dr. Klein recently won the AAALAC International Bennett J. Cohen Award that recognizes outstanding individuals who have, through their exceptional service and significant contributions to AAALAC International, demonstrated a strong and abiding commitment to advancing science through promotion of the highest standards of laboratory animal care in research, testing and education. AAIV is very grateful to Dr. Klein for his many years of service as the delegate to AAALAC. At the end of the current term, Dr. Jennifer Haupt will be taking over the role as the AAIV delegate to AAALAC bringing years of experience and dedication of the humane care and use of animals in biomedical research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AVMA House of Delegates Report</p>



<p>If you have not participated in a Veterinary Leadership Conference, I encourage you to attend. Sure, Chicago can be freezing cold in January, but it can be surprisingly pleasant, and you are indoors most of the time. There also will be fun team-building projects for a good cause.</p>



<p>There are plenty of networking opportunities, insightful sessions on leadership, well-being activities and you can see your AVMA governing body in action on the House of Delegates floor.&nbsp;Click the link for more information:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avma.org/events/veterinary-leadership-conference">Veterinary Leadership Conference | American Veterinary Medical Association</a>
</p>



<p>Journey for Teams</p>



<p>The AVMA is co-launching a multiyear educational initiative to help veterinary workplaces become more diverse, equitable and inclusive. The AVMA and Veterinary Medical Association Executives (VMAE) will deliver monthly learning modules for about 30 months on topics related to DEI on the project’s website. These modules will be about 15 minutes in length and include time to discuss the issues and make plans for changes in a workplace. More information can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.journeyforteams.org/">journeyforteams.org</a>.</p>



<p>How does Journey for Teams work?</p>



<p>Any veterinary professional can sign up to participate in Journey for Teams. Over the next two years, Journey for Teams will release a wide range of resources you can use to learn about DEI topics and build a practical roadmap to advance DEI where you work:</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing and supporting fabulous teams</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fostering an extraordinary workplace</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking the walk with clients, customers and vendors</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embracing the community</p>



<p>You can choose how to use the program. You might decide to delve into the foundational concepts around DEI first, or you might use it to continue work already started. It’s up to you.</p>



<p>Every journey needs a navigator, so the program relies in part on team members who commit to guide discussions, identify possible action items and monitor progress on those actions. The Journey for Teams program provides the resources these navigators need to lead the DEI initiative in their workplace. Participating workplaces are encouraged to include a commitment to DEI core principles and behaviors in their stated values.</p>



<p>What will you gain as a Journey for Teams participant?</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater sense of curiosity</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiration and knowledge to foster respectful dialog</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools to help colleagues better understand and embrace DEI behaviors</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride and satisfaction in the work you do to build a more welcoming community</p>



<p>Through Journey for Teams, you’ll foster your own growth and meaningfully impact the lives of colleagues, customers and the diverse society we’re all committed to serve.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>President’s Perspective: Work-Life Balance</strong>
</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that we have already gotten to the point of passing on the baton to the next president of AAIV. I am confident that Dr. Allison Sateren from Boehringer Ingelheim will be a great leader for our organization. Dr. Sateren and I have worked side by side all year to ensure a seamless transition, and we have collaborated with the board of directors to plan valuable events for next year. We are excited about our new board of directors for 2023 and excited to introduce you to the team at VMX. This will kick off with our networking reception at 5:30-7:30 p.m. Monday, Jan. 16. Check out the section of the newsletter with all our AAIV VMX details below. </p>



<p>I want to now turn our attention to the compensation survey. You probably noticed, if you took it, that it is very different this year. Why does it look different? Dr. Sateren and I formed a “task force” of industry representatives who are hiring managers at several of our major companies. The idea was to streamline the survey for eventual publication looking at the trends over three to five years. We eliminated open-ended questions to make the data clearer to evaluate, and we changed the questions to improve the survey so that it is more useable for hiring managers.&nbsp;We also wanted to capture the differences in salary for those who switch companies, starting salary versus average salary and the importance of work-life balance. For the first time, we will be working with a statistician to ensure that the data is clearly analyzed and able to be used year after year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having looked at the early results, there are some interesting perspectives that I think we all need to consider when recruiting and hiring new veterinarians. This is a compensation survey, which means it is about money, right?&nbsp;Not exactly. One thing that we have noticed in the past few years is that emotional compensation is as important or&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;important than financial compensation to the majority of veterinarians. Money is great, no one will complain about that, but honestly, you cant go onto social media without seeing three or four posts a day about burnout, work-life balance, satisfaction in jobs, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey appears to be capturing that. In the early results that I have seen, for those who have switched jobs or started at a new firm in the past five years, more veterinarians did so for a better work-life balance than anything else. Actually, of the respondents so far, almost 95% did so for a better work-life balance. This is compared to only 40% who changed jobs for a promotion and only 70% for a salary increase. When asked about work-life balance, almost 40% do not find it easy to balance work and personal life in their current role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how do we offer this to our employees? Perhaps we should ask what that looks like. The problem is that all of us see this balance differently. What works for a two-income, no children household is not the same as a sole provider for a family of six. What works for a mother of young children doesn’t work for a grandfather of three dogs. Do we offer a “cafeteria plan” for our new hires: you can choose your own adventure and pick and choose the benefits that work best for you? Is this something that is even achievable for most of us?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our hiring managers out there, what do you think? Perhaps we should take this one step further. Would you like to see an AAIV task force to discuss how we can improve work-life balance? Would you like to help us help you? AAIV wants to know our members thoughts on this. Please reach out to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;to let us know. How can we help you and your colleagues achieve the perfect work-life balance?&nbsp;</p>

<a href="https://aaiv.clubexpress.com/[object%20Object]">Clear The Shelters</a>, NBCUniversal Local’s nationwide pet adoption and donation campaign, and is teaming up with actor Taylor Lautner (<em>Twilight, Scream Queens</em>) to encourage prospective pet owners to find their new best friend during the country’s largest pet adoption of the year.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>A Cause Close to the Heart</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>As a longtime pet lover and owner, Lautner adopted his dog Remi in 2021 and jumped at the opportunity to join this year’s Clear The Shelters campaign.</p>



<p>“Adopting Remi was one of the best decisions my fiancée and I have ever made. She not only completed our family but has also fueled our passion for advocating for shelter pets who are in need of a loving home,” said Lautner. “Hill’s does a great job helping get shelter pets ready for adoption through science-led nutrition. Together we encourage anyone considering adopting a pet to open their hearts and homes to pets in need.”</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>Clear The Shelters…For Good</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>Each year through<a href="https://www.cleartheshelters.com/">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="https://aaiv.clubexpress.com/[object%20Object]">Clear The Shelters</a>, NBC and Telemundo stations nationwide team up with shelters and rescues in their communities, which included more than 1,300 organizations last year, to help find loving homes for pets in need. Since its inception in 2015, the campaign has helped more than 700,000 find their forever homes.</p>



<p>The campaign will again feature online donations through partners&nbsp;<a href="https://greatergood.org/">Greater Good Charities</a>, a global nonprofit, and&nbsp;<a href="https://theanimalrescuesite.greatergood.com/clicktogive/ars/home">The Animal Rescue Site</a>, which will host the fundraising and cover all transaction fees so that 100 percent of donations go directly to shelters and rescues in need. Online donations can be made to participating shelters or rescues during the campaign at&nbsp;<a href="https://store.theanimalrescuesite.greatergood.com/collections/clear-the-shelters-2021">ClearTheSheltersFund.org</a>, which is also accessible via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cleartheshelters.com/">ClearTheShelters.com</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to being a national sponsor, Hill’s will provide adoption kits to new pet parents containing starter bags of Hill’s pet food, coupons, pet-parenting tips and other supplies, which will be available at select shelters throughout the month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the past two decades, Hill’s has helped millions of shelter pets find their forever homes through our Hill’s Food, Shelter &amp; Love program, and we are proud to continue our long-time support of the Clear The Shelter campaign,” said Nicki Baty, President of Hill’s Pet Nutrition US. “We are grateful to work in partnership with Greater Good Charities, Taylor Lautner, and thousands of veterinary, retail and shelter partners nationwide, to help end pet homelessness – especially during a time when shelters are under-resourced and experiencing rising intake rates.”</p>



<p>Hill’s is also providing financial support for the campaign to support two Greater Good Charities “Good Flights” pet airlifts during Clear The Shelters month in August, where at-risk animals in overpopulated shelters will be transported to new shelters to be evaluated and receive needed medical care before being put up for adoption.</p>



<p>With purpose at the heart of everything, Hill’s is empowering its employees to give back to communities and support the initiatives that help drive the brand’s mission forward. Across the organization, hundreds of Hill’s employees will volunteer at participating shelters during Clear The Shelters crescendo weekend August 26-28, 2022 to provide adoption kits to help pet parents welcome their new pets into the family.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>20 Years of Helping Pets Find Forever Homes</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>The year’s campaign also coincides with the 20th Anniversary of<a href="https://www.hillspet.com/shelter-program">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="https://aaiv.clubexpress.com/[object%20Object]">Hill’s Food, Shelter and Love</a>&nbsp;program, which partners with shelters 365 days a year to supply premium pet nutrition for animals in need. The program has provided more than $300 million in pet food to more than 1,000 shelters and has helped more than 12 million pets find new homes.&nbsp;When pet parents purchase Hill’s products, they help us provide premium nutrition to thousands of shelter pets across the country.</p>

<strong>By&nbsp;Debra Nickelson</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>New Initiatives</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Journey For Teams</strong>
</p>



<p>The AVMA is co-launching a multi-year educational initiative to help veterinary workplaces become more diverse, equitable and inclusive. The AVMA and VMAE plan to deliver monthly learning modules for about 30 months on topics related to DEI on the project’s website. These modules will be about 15 minutes in length and includes time to discuss the issues and make plans for changes in a practice. More information can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.journeryforteams.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journeyforteams.org</a>.</p>



<p>
<strong>Coalition for Connected Veterinary Care</strong>
</p>



<p>The AVMA launched this coalition to collaborate across the veterinary and animal health industry to enhance and expand care by leveraging technology, while simultaneously respecting the integrity of the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. The founding members are the AVMA, Veterinary Study Groups and Merck Animal Health along with more than 30 other veterinary organizations and companies that have signed on so far.</p>



<p>
<strong>Reports for Ongoing Activities</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>AVMA Government Relations Division</strong>
</p>



<p>While politics are polarized now, AVMA remains nonpartisan. The AVMA works with those in Congress interested in veterinary issues only. Veterinarians need to be the cause of the good change, not at the effect of someone else’s change. We need to advocate for the protection of our profession. AVMA attempts to expand grasstops and grassroots capabilities, grow the PAC and continue to improve the quality of interactions with state and allied VMAs.</p>



<p>
<strong>AVMA PAC</strong>
</p>



<p>The AVMA Political Action Committee has grown 30% over this time last year. This is an incredible accomplishment, but the new goal is $400k by end-of-year. Membership support is so important. All of the money goes out to Congressmen. The PAC website is updated regularly to show where money goes state by state. PAC funds are distributed on a non-partisan basis focused on veterinary issues only. It’s this historical nonpartisan stance that allows AVMA access to both sides of the aisle.</p>



<p>
<strong>AVMF</strong>
</p>



<p>The mission of the American Veterinary Medical Foundation is to raise funds to improve animal health. The AVMF has raised over half a million dollars for Ukraine relief including supplies, care, food, etc. You can visit the website&nbsp;<a href="http://avmf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avmf.org</a>&nbsp;where you can find stories and heartbreaking images of what our colleagues are going through in this part of the world. New this year to the AVMF mission is education. Since there is an educational debt problem and workforce shortage, the AVMF plans to award 300,000 in scholarships.</p>



<p>
<strong>AVMA Trust</strong>
</p>



<p>AVMA trust doubled down its efforts to provide new and better ways to help, recognizing the needs of members at every step of the journey. For practicing veterinarians: portability, consent to settle, individual coverage limits. For Trust Veterinarians: claims review and advocates.&nbsp;Risk management resources: webinars, publications, educational blogs. For practice owners: practice healthcare solutions, veterinary safety manual, online training and online reputation management.</p>



<p>The next AVMA convention will be held July 14-18, 2023, in Denver.</p>

<p>
<strong>Why You Need a Recruiter . . . Even When the Job Market is Good</strong>
</p>



<p>The VET Recruiter</p>



<p>
<a href="http://www.thevetrecruiter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.thevetrecruiter.com</a>
</p>



<p>You don’t need to be told that the job market is good right now, especially for the best candidates and top professionals. There is a shortage of qualified candidates in most industries and professions, and that includes the animal health industry and veterinary profession. Quite frankly, there may be more opportunities than ever before. Armed with this information and secure in this reality, you may think that the last thing you need is to speak with a recruiter.</p>



<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, all of the reasons that you would need a recruiter in a “normal” job market still exist now. And the argument could be made that you need a recruiter even more now because there are so many opportunities. If you attempt to navigate the job market alone, you might come across opportunities, but how do you know for sure that they are the best ones available… or even the best ones for you?</p>



<p>With this in mind, here are five good reasons why you need an experienced and reputable recruiter, even when the job market is good:</p>



<p>#1—The “hidden job market”</p>



<p>Employers do not post all of their jobs through major job boards, or even on their organization’s website, for that matter. There are multiple reasons for this. It could be a critical, high-level search. Or perhaps they’re looking to replace a low performer and they do not want to advertise the fact that they’re doing so. As a result, only recruiters know about these opportunities because their clients are attempting to fill the positions on a confidential basis. So, if you don’t have a relationship with a recruiter, then there are simply some premium positions about which you will not know.</p>



<p>#2—Valuable intelligence and insight about employers</p>



<p>If you are not working with a recruiter, then the only things you know about an employer will be those things that the employer wants you to know. (Unless, of course, you have a colleague or friend already working at the organization.) Remember that one of the most valuable assets in your job search is information. The more you have, the better positioned you are to grow your career. Recruiters have this information, and they’re willing to share it with you.</p>



<p>#3—An edge during the negotiation stage of the process</p>



<p>An experienced recruiter has negotiated much more than you have during your career. Not only do they have inside information about the employer, but they also have insight regarding how the employer likes to negotiate. They can put both their knowledge and their experience to work for you during the most important part of the hiring process: the negotiation stage. This way, they can help to ensure that you receive the best offer possible, which will set you up for success as you make the next move in your career trajectory.</p>



<p>#4—Time and energy savings</p>



<p>Conducting a job search and/or exploring other employment opportunities requires a certain investment of time and energy. Since you are already fully employed, this is a more difficult task, especially if you want to make sure that you find the best opportunity available and take advantage of it. A recruiter can help do a lot of the “leg work” for you and only present premium opportunities that are clearly better than the job you have right now. This way, you can devote your energy and time to those things that matter the most.</p>



<p>#5—Overall market intelligence</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, information is one of the most valuable assets in your job search or in your career. The more information you have, the better your chances of reaching your goals. A recruiter, especially an experienced one with many years of operating within the profession, has that information and can share it with you as you plot your career course. Their advice and expertise can be incredibly valuable.</p>



<p>So yes, the job market is good right now — even great. However, that does not mean a recruiter can not help you take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the market. They can help you to identify which opportunities are the best, which ones are right for you, and which ones will allow you to grow your career.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Timothy Smaha</p>



<p>Posted:&nbsp;8/11/2022, 4:34 PM</p>



<p>Let me first start by saying thank you to everyone who joined us for the AVMA reception and who attended one of the many sessions that AAIV collaborated on. This AVMA meeting was one of the best to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, for those who didn’t attend the networking event, I wanted to take a second to tell you how AAIV is your advocate in the AVMA.&nbsp;As an affiliate organization, AAIV has a delegate and an alternate delegate to the House of Delegates automatically, and our members represent in other areas as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ellen Lowery, AAIV Delegate to the AVMA House of Delegates;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Deb Nickelson, AAIV Alternate Delegate to the AVMA House of Delegates;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Pam Mitchell – AAIV Secretary and Alternate Delegate to the AVMA House of Delegates for Louisiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the influence of AAIV runs deeper than this. During this most recent election cycle, AAIV nominated several delegates and they were accepted to several committees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Efrem Hunter was nominated and accepted to the Legislative Advisory committee;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Wendy Weirich was nominated and accepted as alternate to the Animal Welfare committee;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Joe Dedrickson was nominated and accepted to the Animal Agriculture Liaison Committee;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Karen Shenoy was nominated and accepted to the Food Safety Advisory Committee (FSAC).</p>



<p>I would like to highlight. Dr Shenoy. For most of these committees, AAIV has an automatic nomination. However, the FSAC position was an at-large position for pet food industry. Dr. Shenoy asked for AAIV to sponsor her for the committee and we did so through an alternate track (meaning we did not have automatic nomination potential).&nbsp;This is a good example of how AAIV can work for you. As an affiliate of the AVMA, AAIV can help to provide access to these important aspects of organized veterinary medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I personally often get questions about “why should I join AAIV?” or simply “what’s in it for me?”&nbsp;Well, there are so many things that AAIV can do for you, but as with all things in life, there is a better return on investment when you put more into it.&nbsp;Dr. Weirich, Dr. Shenoy and Dr. Hunter all utilized their membership and connection with AAIV to get them on the committees that they wanted to represent. They are all now leaders among your AVMA, our AVMA.&nbsp;Are you the next future leader of the AVMA? Let us help you, and let’s get industry veterinarians represented across the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not interested in organized vet med? That’s OK! There are so many other things we can help with. Everyday I go online and see veterinarians asking about “how do I get into industry?” or “what can I do with my degree besides private practice?”&nbsp;Well, we got you covered there too. Our members have access to our job board which highlights the jobs of most major companies currently hiring. Many jobs are highlighted every week on our social media pages as well so be sure to follow for the most up to date job postings. Furthermore, with a network of over 400 veterinary professionals, we have experience all across industry from regulatory to corporate practice field leadership to pharmaceutical companies. Through our networking receptions, webinars and mentoring program, there is always someone there who knows what you are going through and who is willing to help. Let our networking potential work for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already in industry and just looking for a transition to a new role? Did you know that the compensation survey we do each year has the influence of hiring managers from several different industry partners? As a member you have instant access to the results of the previous surveys and can utilize this information for your own contract negotiations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe none of these work for you, but let me turn the question of “what’s in it for me” around. Let us know what you want to see. AAIV is your organization. Let’s make it work for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Tim Smaha</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Jennifer Kasten</p>



<p>Our field-based veterinary colleagues quite simply are not meant to be home all the time. Fortunately, over the last nine months many travel restrictions associated with the pandemic have eased, and most of us are getting back on the road on a fairly regular basis. Mask mandates are lifting all over the country, but many of us find ourselves still wearing them or at least so situationally. Events may be smaller, and many conferences are still offering hybrid options which require us to work even harder to make the most out of the facetime we get.</p>



<p>While the return to travel is welcome, most of us are finding things to be not as easy as they used to be. For those of us who don’t live in a city with a major airline hub, air travel has become more complicated.&nbsp;Flight options to hubs are fewer than in the past and departure times are not nearly as convenient as before. Trying to get to another small city? Good luck and enjoy spending a whole day traveling. Once you arrive at the destination, rental car options remain quite a challenge. If cars are available at all, they tend to be quite expensive. Does your company have a preferred/contracted vendor? So does every other company and chances are those rental lots are just as empty! The best chance of success with rental cars seems to be booking early, perhaps even before your plans are finalized.</p>



<p>Of all aspects of travel, hotels seem to have normalized the most. Housekeeping tends to be on demand only, but did we really need it every day anyway? Perhaps the restaurant options in the hotels are fewer or room service is not as available. The good news is delivery services such as Uber Eats and Grubhub are much more widely available in cities and towns than they were pre-pandemic. Hopefully none of us will ever again find ourselves settling for a protein bar from the stash in our work bags for dinner!</p>



<p>While it may vary depending on your company or your customer, business attire has become more casual than it was prior to the pandemic. Maybe we can travel with fewer things since there is less of a difference between work and after-hours attire than there used to be. More comfortable clothes for long-haul trips are only a good thing. Speaking of packing, are there new staples in your work bag now? For one of my colleagues, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes have become a must.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What changes in travel have you noticed now that we have moved past the peak of the pandemic? Are you embracing those changes? What do you wish would go back to the way it was before? We would love to hear from you! Reach out to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;or on any of our social media channels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>AVMA Legislative Report</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>April 2022</strong>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>Since AVMA is involved in several legislative activities, here is a separate report.</p>



<p>
<strong>AVMA secures funding for programs essential to the veterinary profession&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Recently, Congress passed a government spending bill that includes many wins for veterinary medicine. During this process, the AVMA has been engaged with lawmakers and working with coalitions to advocate for funding programs critical to the profession. These programs include:</p>



<p>·&nbsp;<strong>Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program&nbsp;(VMLRP)&nbsp;</strong>will receive an increase of $1 million in funding from the last fiscal year for a total of $9.5 million. VMLRP plays a critical role in closing food animal and public health veterinary medicine access gaps by offering three years of educational repayment in exchange for service in USDA-designated veterinarian shortage areas.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;<strong>Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database Program (FARAD)</strong>&nbsp;will receive $2.5 million to protect the U.S. food supply against accidental or intentional contamination of animal-derived foods so that it is safe for human consumption.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;<strong>Veterinary Services Grant Program (VSGP)&nbsp;</strong>has been allocated an additional $500,000 in funding for a total of $3.5 million. VSGP is a federal program that provides grants to develop, implement and sustain veterinary services and relieve veterinarian shortage situations across the United States.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;<strong>USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspective Service (APHIS)&nbsp;</strong>will use $1 million to strengthen the oversight of imported dogs.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;<strong>USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)&nbsp;</strong>has been given $2.8 million to address the high levels of public health veterinarian vacancies.</p>



<p>
<strong>One Health legislation passes Senate Committee&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>On March 15, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions passed the PREVENT Pandemics Act which included provisions that would require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a One Health framework. The legislation would have the CDC coordinate with the Agriculture and Interior Secretaries on One Health and issue a report to Congress on their progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>USDA opens FY 2022 application cycle for Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program</strong>
</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) announced the opening of the fiscal year 2022 application cycle for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP).</p>



<p>Under the VMLRP, food animal and public health veterinarians receive up to $25,000 a year for student loan repayment in exchange for at least three years of service in one of the USDA-designated rural veterinary shortage areas. There are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/vmlrp-map?utm_source=delivra&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=AVMA%20Advocate%20-%20March%202022&amp;utm_id=3552859&amp;dlv-emuid=36b8987e-9b25-4a3d-8c23-459e85fe6a30&amp;dlv-mlid=3552859" target="_blank">227 veterinarian shortage situations</a>&nbsp;in 46 states for FY 2022.</p>

<p>
<strong>AVMA House of Delegates Report</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>April 2022</strong>
</p>



<p>It seems there are two seasons for the AVMA House of Delegates: meetings and getting ready for meetings.</p>



<p>In preparation for the summer meeting during the AVMA Convention, we are looking for&nbsp;<strong>Veterinary Information Forum (VIF)</strong>&nbsp;topics to discuss and possibly be formed into resolutions for policy. So far, here are the VIF topics:</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VCPR and telemedicine/telehealth</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterinary technician and assistant roles and responsibilities</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency care responsibilities</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly paraprofessionals</p>



<p>License portability and the model practice act will be discussed to follow up from the winter meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyone can submit VIF topics, so please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;if you would like the AVMA to address any issues. Your delegate Dr. Ellen Lowery and I would be happy to discuss these issues with you and formulate them into a VIF topic or even a resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are attending AVMA convention, you are welcome to observe the general sessions of the House of Delegates on:&nbsp;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, July 28, 10 a.m. to noon</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, July 29, 8 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.</p>



<p>Let me know if you are interested in stopping by and I will provide more details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was honored to join a new HOD Member Engagement Working Group in which we work on ways to increase communication, engagement, and involvement of the House of Delegates members and to promote participation at all levels. We meet once a month, have completed a survey of HOD members and will send proposals to AVMA on how to better communicate with the HOD, but also with all AVMA members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Timothy Smaha</p>



<p>When I first addressed the membership late last year, I promised that the goal of our board in 2022 was to revamp the organization to be more about YOU as the member. You will see that many of these changes are in the works. I want to highlight some of those for you. Before we dive in, I would also like to <strong>welcome our newest sponsors: Vetoquinol and Antelligence (The Fountain Report)</strong>. Look for more information from these and all our sponsors in the future.</p>



<p>First, let’s talk about the newsletter. The Board of Directors voted earlier this year to go from six newsletters a year to a quarterly newsletter. Our goal is to streamline the newsletters and enhance the content to make it more applicable to your everyday life. Having said that, welcome to the first quarterly AAIV newsletter! Look for these to come in the middle of each quarter. In addition to content from our board members, we will also be featuring articles and blog posts from partners outside of AAIV so to bring more applicable content to our members.</p>



<p>Secondly, having launched our mentorship program last year, we continue to grow the program and are always looking for new mentors and mentees. Hopefully we can utilize our mentorship program to match our sponsors and members with veterinarians who are seeking to transition in their careers. We need mentors from all aspects of industry! If you have not signed up yet, please go to our website and check it out.</p>



<p>Mentorship</p>



<p>Next, the annual compensation survey has historically been a major endeavor for our group and there is no other survey out there like it. Look for us to begin soliciting responses in early fall for the 2021 compensation survey. Additionally, we have made some strategic changes to make this more applicable for our members. This includes:</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formation of an “advisory committee” from our industry partners to help select questions and analyze data</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership with Antelligence for press releases and periodic analytical articles</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement with a statistician to have the data analyzed before AND after the survey to ensure that the data is useable and statistically significant</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More HR specific questions that focus on benefits, quality of life, financial questions and additional data points</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling of data for an eventual “5 year trend” to mark any changes seen over time</p>



<p>Lastly, let’s talk about our webinar series “AAIV presents.” We have already had two webinars this year: Dr. Darby Affeldt talking about the top 10 financial mistakes you could be making and Christine Splichal talking about leveraging your LinkedIn profile. With that, we are very excited to announce the lineup for the remainder of the year. Stay tuned for announcements about the exact dates and times.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>June 9, 5 p.m. CST – Amy Grice, V.M.D., will present on “Leadership at All Levels.”&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Grice is a renowned speaker and one of the founding facilitators of Decade One, a program that focuses on mentoring Equine Veterinarians in the first 10 years of practice.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>September 2022 – Betsy Charles, D.V.M. will present on conflict management and resolution&nbsp;</strong>for future leaders in veterinary industry. Dr. Charles is on the Board of Directors for Veterinary Leadership Institute and the executive director for Veterinary Leadership Experience.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>November 2022 – Offered in conjunction with VMRCVM Public Health and Corporate Medicine and ‘Friend of AAIV’: Pawsibilities Vet Med</strong>. We will have a hosted roundtable discussion with a group of industry professionals to discuss career transitions and how to land that perfect industry position.</p>



<p>As always, if you need anything from me or from any of our board members or AVMA HOD delegates, please reach out to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:industryvets@gmail.com">industryvets@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;and we will get you in contact with the right person as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;Timothy Smaha</p>



<p>Pay it Forward with AAIV’s Mentor Program</p>



<p>Happy 2022! Who would have thought that we would still be here two years later? With testing, vaccines, virtual learning, cancelled plans, masks and more, this is our new normal. Think back when you first started in industry, did you ever think that things would be quite like this? More generally, how did you know what this industry would be like when you first started?</p>



<p>The industry is changing, and with that the demands on our industry colleagues are changing. This will inevitably lead to the opening of new positions, retirements&nbsp;and people looking for a change in responsibilities. There is not a day that goes by that I do not see two&nbsp;or three&nbsp;posts on social media about veterinarians wanting to get out of clinical practice, and how to break into industry. But, have we, as an industry, really prepared ourselves and our businesses to have all of these new colleagues? What can we tell them to expect? Do they realize that our jobs, mostly travel based for years, now involve endless hours of Zoom meetings and periods of quarantine? Do they realize that the “glamorous lifestyle” we have as traveling veterinarians really just translates to hours of sitting in airports, living out of suitcases and hopping from hotel to hotel? I often find myself telling people that it doesn’t matter where in the world you are&nbsp;—&nbsp;the Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo in the United Kingdom, or the Hampton Inn in London, Kentucky&nbsp;—&nbsp;they all look and feel the same inside. Do we love our jobs? Of course. Are we glamorous jet-setters? Not quite. And luckily I knew what I was signing up for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I met my mentor 20 years ago while in vet school at Auburn. We have stayed in touch through the years and watched each other change jobs many times. Finally, after a 20 year mentorship and friendship, we work in the same company and both love what we do. I know that I never would have gotten this job, joined AAIV or be writing you this letter had it not been for my mentor. That is why last year when AAIV launched the mentor program, I signed up immediately. Since we launched the program in 2021, I was matched with a couple of mentees. On Jan. 24, my mentee began her career in industry, thanks to AAIV and our mentor program.&nbsp;This is our first successful mentor-mentee match that has led to a clinical veterinarian joining our ranks as a professional services veterinarian. Having said that, I know that this will not be the last success story. I just hope that she will also pay it forward and turn her successful experience as a mentee into a successful mentorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AAIV mentorship program was designed to be a way to match early career veterinarians with more seasoned professionals as we transition through these crazy times and the ever changing nature of what we do. However, it also has become a good tool for prepping aspiring industry veterinarians and recruiting new talent. There is so much opportunity out there and so much talent that needs to just find a way through the challenging and all too impersonal human resources platforms.</p>



<p>That is why today, I urge everyone to please join the&nbsp;<a href="https://aaiv.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=29758&amp;module_id=483740">AAIV Mentorship Program</a>. Let’s work together to prepare the next generation of industry veterinarians.</p>

<p>
<strong>AVMA House of Delegates Report</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Winter Meeting 2022</strong>
</p>



<p>The winter session of the AVMA House of Delegates occurred Jan. 7-8 during the Veterinary Leadership Conference in Chicago. This was a hybrid meeting in which many delegates, including Dr. Ellen Lowery, attended virtually. Dr. Pam Mitchell, representing Louisiana, and I attended in person.</p>



<p>
<strong>Resolutions</strong>
</p>



<p>
<em>Resolution #1</em>&nbsp;Revised Policy on Rabies</p>



<p>·&nbsp;This was a clarification of wording of the importance of vaccination in animals.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;Passed.</p>



<p>
<em>Resolution #2</em>&nbsp;Revised Policy on Annual Rabies Vaccination Waiver</p>



<p>·&nbsp;This was a clarification and simplification of the policy on annual rabies vaccination waiver.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;Passed.</p>



<p>
<em>Resolution #3</em>&nbsp;New Policy on Food Safety</p>



<p>· This restructured policy was supported by the food animal allied groups. It streamlined language to identify components of an effective and comprehensive food safety program.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;Passed.</p>



<p>
<em>Resolution #4</em>&nbsp;New Policy on Support for the Collection of Antimicrobial Use Data for Antimicrobial Stewardship</p>



<p>·&nbsp;This resolution supported the collection of data and analysis regarding antimicrobial use.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;The AVMA won’t perform the study but would publish an article in JAVMA to provide additional background for the policy and serve as an educational resource.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·&nbsp;Referred to the House Advisory Committee.</p>



<p>
<em>Resolution #5</em>&nbsp;Revised Policy on Guidelines for Classifying Veterinary Facilities</p>



<p>·&nbsp;There are many definitions on how veterinary facilities are named and other organizations have been trying to develop consistent polices.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;During discussions, it was clear that our list was incomplete and needs more work.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;Referred to the House Advisory Committee.</p>



<p>
<strong>Veterinary Information Forum Topics</strong>
</p>



<p>
<em>License portability</em>
</p>



<p>·&nbsp;I expressed how helpful this may be for those of you who still want to practice or volunteer part-time if your company or another position moves you to another state.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;While license portability is supported in general, every state has its own requirements and directives.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;The HOD requested that the AVMA Board of Directors further explore the issue with consideration given to existing policies and the need for collaboration with state and allied associations.</p>



<p>
<em>Expansion of AVMA membership to veterinary technicians/nurses, practice managers and other veterinary professionals.</em>
</p>



<p>·&nbsp;There was much discussion about what expanded AVMA membership would look like and do for members.</p>



<p>·&nbsp;The HOD requested that the AVMA Board of Directors consider creating a pathway of communication with other veterinary health care team organizations, starting with the National Association of Veterinary Technicians in American and the Veterinary Hospital Manager Association to investigate how to best work collaboratively to strengthen their organizations and professions as well as the AVMA.</p>



<p>Let us know what questions you have and be sure to share any concerns that you would like your AAIV and the AVMA to consider. The next meeting is during the AVMA Convention on&nbsp;July 29 to Aug. 1 in Philadelphia.</p>

</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>If you are working in clinical practice and looking for a job in industry, you may be thinking you do not have the experience companies seek for technical service, marketing, or other business positions. You would be surprised to know that the clinical and people skills that practicing veterinarians exhibit every day are exactly the skills that companies need.</p>



<p>For instance, if you are exceptional at managing patients with a specific disease condition, say diabetes, what can you do to add business skills on top of your excellent clinical skills? You know diabetes involves people management about as much as animal management, so here are some ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Create easy to follow handouts for clients about diabetes, what it means for their pet, what to expect, what problems to look for and how to respond. Sure, you can use the available published handouts, but make it personal for that particular pet and client. And make it comply with your and your hospital’s procedures.</li>



<li> Host a Facebook Live or a Zoom support group meeting for owners of pets with diabetes. You may have to separate the dog and cat owners as each has their own issues. Invite the pets too. People like nothing more than showing off and talking about their pets. And they may have useful hints for other members of the group. Just send out an invite to your selected client list with caveat that they are willing to share as much information about their pet as they are comfortable.</li>



<li>With clients’ permission, post a success story about well managed pet with diabetes on your clinic web page, Facebook page, or whatever social media you choose. And when someone does achieve success in giving injections or monitoring their pet or even figuring out how to fill the syringe, celebrate in the support group and online. </li>



<li>Teach an on-line class about diabetes in pets via Zoom or whatever media you have. It can be a simple presentation with lots of photos and you can show how to measure out doses and how to give injections. This can be open to non-clients so just advertise when and the link. Or make it on-demand. Or teach it via local community education.</li>
</ul>



<p>Then you can add to your resume about how you did all this to increase client compliance by a certain percent, increased client satisfaction as measured by surveys, increased the number of new clients by how many in a time frame, and increased clinic revenue by how much over previous year.</p>



<p>And you will have fun doing it!</p>

<strong>By&nbsp;Debra Nickelson, D.V.M.</strong>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>One of the most sought after “soft skills” in the business world is&nbsp;<strong>adaptability</strong>. The modern workplace is ever changing, including veterinary practices, as you know. If an employee does not adapt to change, there can be serious repercussions on the individual and the business. To maintain profitability and engagement, employers are seeking job candidates who can demonstrate their capability to acclimate and thrive under changing conditions.</p>



<p>Companies look for candidates who are resilient, innovative and calm under pressure. How does a hiring manager know that you have these qualities? The interviewer asks the candidate to share examples of situations in which the person has demonstrated these capabilities.</p>



<p>Let’s consider these scenarios:</p>



<p>
<em>Tell me about a time when you had to work with someone who was either difficult or dismissive of you.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Easy one. Everyone has clients who fit this description. Briefly describe the situation, how you handled the client and relate the positive outcome.</p>



<p>
<em>How did you handle a sudden change in a project after putting in a considerable amount of time into it?</em>
</p>



<p>Maybe you tried to institute a new procedure or service in the veterinary clinic and after a lot of work, the owner or practice manager decided not to implement your idea.&nbsp; Did you discover the concerns? Did you modify your idea to meet these concerns? What did you do? And what happened?</p>



<p>
<em>Describe a situation in which you were given a task out of your usual scope of work and how you handled it.</em>
</p>



<p>Maybe you were given supervisor responsibilities for the support staff. Or maybe you were charged with the practice social media. Be sure to describe how you leaned to perform these duties and how the practice benefitted from your leadership.</p>



<p>
<em>When starting a new job, what are the biggest challenges?</em>
</p>



<p>This question gives you several opportunities to demonstrate how you leaned to adapt to a new culture, a new situation, new co-workers, new procedures.&nbsp; Write down some answers now, so you are ready to show how adaptable you are in a business work environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And always be positive! Let us know how we can help.</p>

<p>The previous article lists job requirements that involve soft skills and how your clinical examples translate to those skills. Here are some more technical job requirements and how your education and skills would meet them. You meet more job requirements that you think, so expand your thinking and believe in yourself.</p>



<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Job Requirement</strong>
</td>
<td>
<strong>What that Means</strong>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Clinical Examples</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Technology management</td>
<td>Keep current on technological developments, use technology to achieve results, secure systems</td>
<td>Practice management software, laboratory equipment, herd management systems</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Financial management</td>
<td>Prepare budgets, oversee procurement and contracts, monitor expenses, consider cost benefit for setting priorities</td>
<td>Practice management, inventory, supply company contracts, budgets for clients</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accountability</td>
<td>Hold self and others accountable for SMART objectives, set priorities, delegate work, accept responsibility for mistakes</td>
<td>Practice management, average client transaction, production levels, standard operating procedures, regulatory compliance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Human capital management</td>
<td>Build and manage workforce according to organizational goals, needs and budget, recruit, select, train, appraise employees, act on performance challenges</td>
<td>Practice management, train and evaluate employees, hire, fire, set raises and bonus decisions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entrepreneurship</td>
<td>Identify new opportunities for organization, develop or improve products and services, take calculated risks for organizational goals</td>
<td>Practice management, new services, new equipment, practice growth, client outreach</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strategic thinking</td>
<td>Formulate objectives and priorities, implement plans consistent with organizational goals, capitalize on opportunities and manage risks</td>
<td>Practice management, business plans, herd improvement plans, exit strategies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Problem solving</td>
<td>Identify and analyze problems, consider accuracy of information, generate and evaluate solutions, make recommendations</td>
<td>Practice management, client interactions, diagnosis, treatment, follow up plans, herd evaluations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Creativity and innovation</td>
<td>Develop insights into situations, encourage new ideas and innovations, design and implement new programs and processes</td>
<td>Practice management, client communication, education, and compliance, new programs</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<p>Again, do you see a pattern? All these more technical skills involve practice management and you do that every day, with your co-workers, employees and clients.&nbsp; So when you are asked in an interview, “Tell me about a program you initiated and how it worked out,” you can give an example of how you and the team started a new service for the practice, how you advertised that to clients, what was the response and how much actual or percent of growth resulted for the practice. Again, behavioral interviewing.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What was the opportunity</li>



<li>What you did</li>



<li>What were the results</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;Good luck and let us know how we can help!</p>

<p>
</p>



<p>During the Women’s Veterinary Summit at WVC, Dr. Mia Cary of Cary Consulting and (former AAIV President) led a discussion on Leadership Strategies: Leading to Team Satisfaction and Productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most organizations (including AAIV) have a mission and vision to keep everyone moving towards a common goal, you can apply Personal Purpose Statements for your personal leadership. These statements are short (1-2 sentences), action oriented, ever evolving and answer these questions:</p>



<p>•&nbsp;Mission: Why do I exist?<br>•&nbsp;Vision: What is my desired future state?<br>•&nbsp;Purpose: What matters most to me?<br>•&nbsp;Core values: How do I go about it?</p>



<p>A couple examples of a personal purpose statement:</p>



<p>•&nbsp;My purpose is to help others identify their gifts and transform goals into reality.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;My purpose is to provide others the opportunities for them to recognize and build their leadership qualities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have created a personal purpose statement, analyze your current activities and actions against that purpose. Your organizations and AAIV do this – review plans and activities based on feedback, analysis and strategic planning. Both you and organizations ask:</p>



<p>•&nbsp;What should start?&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;What should stop?&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;What should continue?&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;What should change?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this list should be periodically reviewed with the modifications to your personal purpose statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then think about how you translate your personal purpose to how you lead others and teams. There are five behaviors of a cohesive team, according to Patrick Lencioni (The Five Dysfunctions of a Team) which are comprised of satisfied employees that operate at a consistently high level of productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>•&nbsp;Build trust – Abandon pride and fear so each team member can simply be themselves.<br>•&nbsp;Master conflict – Enable team members to engage in productive, unfiltered debates of ideas and concepts, without personal attacks.<br>•&nbsp;Achieve commitment – Move forward with complete clarity and buy-in from every team member.<br>•&nbsp;Embrace accountability – Hold each other accountable based on each members’ role and responsibility with respectful problem solving and performance management.<br>•&nbsp;Focus on shared results – Value collective outcomes more than individual results, enjoy success and analyze failure acutely, honestly and openly.</p>

</p>



<p>When you study industry job descriptions, what comes to mind? Do you think, “Sure, I have the skills and experience for this job – I could really make significant contributions.” Or do you think, “I have never worked with an animal health company. I don’t even know what these terms mean, and I certainly can’t even think of applying.”</p>



<p>Please believe that your veterinary degree, your continuing education, your clinical experience, your problem-solving ability and your communications skills DO translate to jobs in non-clinical practice. Let’s start with a list of soft skills that are found on many job descriptions with this table of examples.</p>



<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Job Requirement</strong>
</td>
<td>
<strong>What that Means</strong>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Clinical Examples</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oral and written communication</td>
<td>Clear and convincing presentations, effective listening, clear, organized and convincing writing</td>
<td>Client interactions, employee training, medical records, newsletters, community education</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interpersonal skills</td>
<td>Emotional intelligence, courtesy, tact, respect, appropriate responses</td>
<td>Client interactions, employee management, sales rep meetings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Conflict management</td>
<td>Encourage constructive differences of opinion, constructively manage and resolve conflicts</td>
<td>Client interactions and complaints, employee and associate management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team Building</td>
<td>Inspire and encourage team commitment and trust, facilitate cooperation, motivate team members to accomplish group goals</td>
<td>Client interactions, practice management, employee and associate management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Influencing and negotiating</td>
<td>Persuade others, build consensus, gain cooperation to accomplish goals</td>
<td>Client interactions, employee and associate management, salary negotiations, sales rep discussions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Developing others</td>
<td>Coach others to perform and contribute by providing ongoing feedback and opportunities to expand skills</td>
<td>Client interactions and training, employee training, evaluating employees, continuing education, mentoring</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Decisiveness</td>
<td>Make effective and timely decisions with limited data and possible unpleasant solutions</td>
<td>Client interactions, diagnosis, treatment plan, prognosis, triage, employee and associate management</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<p>Do you see a pattern? All these soft skills involve effective communication and you do that every day, with all sorts of clients. And you work with your team every day, when they are in all sorts of moods and abilities. So when you are asked in an interview, “Tell me how you would manage a conflict situation,” you can give an example of when a client was very unhappy because of something, how you responded and then what happened. That is called behavioral interviewing.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What happened</li>



<li>What you did</li>



<li>What were the results</li>
</ul>



<p>See, you can do this!</p>

<p>What kinds of traits and experience do employers seek? Employers looks for evidence of leadership skills and the ability to work as a team player. Since many jobs involve working with veterinary customers, they value a candidate’s experience in veterinary practice, with or without ownership. Some positions prefer board certification in a specialty or an MBA for more marketing roles. An understanding of or willingness to learn business principles is a plus, as every job in veterinary industry involves business. Excellent communication and analytical skills with problem solving abilities are highly valued. Employers are looking for people with self-confidence, a strong work ethic and a professional business image. Flexibility, a positive attitude and sense of humor serves a candidate looking for a job in industry.</p>



<p>You already have most of these traits and skills, just being in practice. You already provide excellent customer service, communicate with different types of people, solve problems, educate clients and handle complaints. You already explain complex concepts in an understandable way, and you sell your diagnostic and treatment recommendations besides the necessary products.</p>

<p>
<strong>Make sure the content is relevant to the participants.</strong>
<br>People who attend your training have specific situations they want addressed, even if they are not sure of which situations. Ideally, find out before your presentation. Then make it clear what situations or problems you are solving. Be concise, and use concrete examples.<br>
<strong>
<br>Use easy-to-understand language.</strong>
<br>Think about having a conversation with someone. You don’t want that person trying to guess what you are trying to say – they will lose the message. Usually, adults will not ask you to explain your vocabulary; they will just tune you out.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use humor in your training.</strong>
<br>As long as the humor is used to put people at ease and help the audience see you as one of them, it can be very effective. Do not joke about religion, politics, sports or anything that could alienate a type of person or culture.<br>
<strong>
<br>Avoid prejudices.</strong>
<br>As noted above, do not make comments that could diminish a person’s self-esteem. Eliminate your own prejudices when addressing the audience and responding to individual comments and questions. If your words and body language are open and inclusive, then your audience will share the camaraderie.<br>
<br>
<strong>Consider the participants’ knowledge and experience.</strong>
<br>Adults bring a vast range of knowledge and experience about whatever topic you are discussing. Ask people to share so they can learn from each other. Many people attend a training in order to meet other people and learn from them, as it is not all about you.<br>
<strong>
<br>Keep the trainings active.</strong>
<br>Considering the average adult’s attention span is about 30 minutes, you must incorporate activities in your training to keep participants focused and attentive. As mentioned above, ask people to share, with the entire group and/or in small groups. Ask people to stand, move about, do some teamwork, write something, look up a topic on their phone, do some on-line polling or present to the group.<br>
<strong>
<br>Respect the time.</strong>
<br>Adults are well-aware of when things should start and end. Even if some people come late or leave early, you must keep on schedule. Practice your presentation and leave time for questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On February 11, 2019, Brenda Andersen delivered an interactive webinar, “How (and Why) to Assess and Then Convey Your Value to Senior Leadership.”</p>



<p>Brenda is the Chief Strategy Officer, Stephens and Associates and Founding Partner, The Bridge Club.<br>Brenda took the participants, in thoughtful progression from self-assessment of skills to demonstrating value to leadership.</p>



<p>She shared Peter Drucker’s “Managing Oneself,” published in the Harvard Business Review, 1999 for the self-assessment.</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;“What are my strengths?”<br>2.&nbsp;“How do I work?”<br>3.&nbsp;“What are my values?”<br>4.&nbsp;“Where do I belong?”<br>5.&nbsp;“The second half of my life”<br>6.&nbsp;“Take responsibility for relationships”<br>7.&nbsp;“What should I contribute?”</p>



<p>She discussed value and how to determine what is valued by senior leadership. The steps to learn this are: Watch, Listen, Act , Respond. To demonstrate one’s value, one must show up, speak up, share, solve, and support.<br>She summarized and emphasized:</p>



<p>•&nbsp;Don’t assume good work will speak for itself—the burden is usually on you to find a way to communicate with your boss.<br>•&nbsp;Don’t hide your contributions, ideas, success – be very visible about your skills, your contributions, and your connection to what’s important to the company<br>•&nbsp;DON’T HESITATE TO ASK FOR OPPORTUNITY AND TO SHOW WHERE YOUR SKILLS BRING VALUE TO YOUR ORGANIZATION.<br>•&nbsp;THIS IS A SHOW AND TELL WORLD –&nbsp; YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR ORGANIZATION WHAT YOU CAN DO AND TELL THEM HOW YOU PLAN TO DO IT&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members may access a recording of the full webinar by logging in to their AAIV member account and visiting the Webinar Archive page under the Member Toolbox tab.</p>

<p>
</p>



<p>Why do you want to work in veterinary industry?</p>



<p>You may have several reasons, such as a desire for more pay and better benefits, regular hours and perceived improved work/life balance. You may be disillusioned with clinical practice, prefer not to work with clients or want to work by yourself at home. There may be practical reasons, such as animal allergies or a need for more comprehensive insurance. Alternatively, you may see intellectual challenge, broadened skills or specialized training. You may relish the opportunity to work with cutting edge science and medicine and the ability to contribute to the future of human and animal health.</p>



<p>While any or all these reasons may be valid to you, it is important to emphasize the positive reasons when talking to anyone about why you want to transition to veterinary industry. Consider every encounter a potential interview because you never know who may know someone looking to hire an industry veterinarian. Also, keep in your mind the more negative reasons you want to leave practice when looking at job descriptions. Some industry jobs do involve working weekends and/or nights, visiting clinical practices, extensive travel and communicating with other veterinarian’s disgruntled clients.</p>



<p>Corporate and industry careers in veterinary medicine do offer fantastic and varied opportunities. A career in veterinary industry may allow you to lead and influence the entire veterinary profession. The excitement, the longer term and more encompassing goals, the servant leadership to veterinary profession, the pay and benefits allow you to experience a different type of satisfaction in your professional and personal life. And you will enjoy unlimited potential for professional growth.</p>



<p>Whatever your reasons for considering a career in veterinary industry, know your pros and cons while looking at specific jobs. For example, while there will not be the life and death emergencies of clinical practice, your boss may consider an opportunity to buy a product line from another company or a serious product adverse event, “an emergency” and expect all hands on-deck outside of normal hours.</p>



<p>Travel is another issue that means different things to different people and can be the most common objection. Travel can mean driving in the city to flying internationally. According to American Association of Industry Veterinarians 2018 Compensation Survey, about 60% of industry veterinarians reported traveling 20% to 60% or 6-18 days per month. Over 75% of industry veterinarians reported they travel less than 13 days per month and over 14% do not travel at all.</p>



<p>The same compensation survey with 104 respondents reported that the average 2017 annual salary was $146,140 with a range of $60,000 to $325,000. Target bonus ranged from $2,000 to $250,000 with a mean of $31,309. &nbsp;In addition, American Association of Industry Veterinarians asked about job satisfaction and work life balance. Of those people who responded, almost 85% reported they were extremely, very or somewhat satisfied with their job. And over 50% reported that their work life balance was moderately to extremely easy.</p>



<p>How do you find a job in veterinary industry?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>With a positive attitude, look at industry as an opportunity, not an escape from practice.</li>



<li>Try to gain some business experience according to your interests via internships, volunteerism or other programs.</li>



<li>Capitalize on speaking, writing and media projects.</li>



<li>Join American Association of Industry Veterinarians, via aaivet.org.</li>



<li>Develop a relationship with a recruiter, such as The Vet Recruiter®.</li>



<li>Network constantly, via professional meetings, local events and LinkedIn.</li>



<li>Serve as both a mentor and a mentee.</li>



<li>Look at company career portals and other animal health websites.</li>



<li>Visit with sales representatives and exhibitors.</li>



<li>Look for the best contact and find the hiring manager to send your resume.</li>



<li>Consider every contact an interview and practice your “elevator speech.”</li>



<li>Be enthusiastic and don’t give up.</li>
</ul>



<p>What companies hire veterinarians?</p>



<p>There are human pharmaceutical companies with an animal health division, along with animal health companies specializing in biologics, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, nutrition, medical supplies and equipment. Pet and livestock insurance companies hire veterinarians for their businesses. Consider pet industry companies that serve both pet retailers and consumers. Remember that practitioners do business with animal health distributors. Look at the start-up ventures, as they claim their space in the animal health market. Marketing and advertising agencies serve all these companies and sometimes need veterinary expertise.</p>



<p>What kinds of work are involved in veterinary industry?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research – biomedical, clinical, field, environmental, genetics, pharmacological, animal care</li>



<li>Business – intercompany licensing, mergers, acquisitions, negotiations, executive leadership</li>



<li>Regulatory affairs – product registration, pharmacovigilance, compliance</li>



<li>Product support – marketing, technical services, customer service, field sales</li>



<li>Research and development – production, project management, quality assurance</li>



<li>Communications – writing, editing, blogging, social media, public relations</li>
</ul>



<p>What can you do for a company? Basically, companies look for employees who either make money or decrease costs. Think of what you do in practice now to make money or decrease costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This table lists some examples of jobs and functions, considering actual jobs are mostly cross-functional.</p>

<p>What kinds of traits and experience do employers seek? Employers looks for evidence of leadership skills and the ability to work as a team player. Since many jobs involve working with veterinary customers, they value a candidate’s experience in veterinary practice, with or without ownership. Some positions prefer board certification in a specialty or an MBA for more marketing roles. An understanding of or willingness to learn business principles is a plus, as every job in veterinary industry involves business. Excellent communication and analytical skills with problem solving abilities are highly valued. Employers are looking for people with self-confidence, a strong work ethic and a professional business image. Flexibility, a positive attitude and sense of humor serves a candidate looking for a job in industry.</p>



<p>You already have most of these traits and skills, just being in practice. You already provide excellent customer service, communicate with different types of people, solve problems, educate clients and handle complaints. You already explain complex concepts in an understandable way, and you sell your diagnostic and treatment recommendations besides the necessary products.</p>



<p>You may pursue additional education or experience with business classes, marketing projects, taking on management responsibilities and writing or blogging. Kansas State University in Olathe, KS offers the Professional Science Master in Applied Science and Technology as an industry-focused graduate program designed for students to pursue advanced training in the sciences while simultaneously developing professional skills highly valued by employers. More information can be found on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olathe.k-state.edu/psm">www.olathe.k-state.edu/psm</a>.</p>



<p>In conclusion, a veterinary degree provides many opportunities and potential for professional growth. Careers in industry are just as rewarding as practice, but often impact the entire profession. Always be positive about veterinary practice because your practitioner colleagues are the customers of the companies with whom you may work. Don’t burn any bridges because you may have to cross that bridge to work with another company. Veterinary industry is a relatively small group. You will know most people and most people will know you. Welcome aboard!</p>

<p>“Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t—you’re right.”&nbsp; Henry Ford</p>



<p>Mindset – the established set of attitudes held by someone; a person’s way of thinking and their opinions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Literature defines two basic mindsets that shape us.&nbsp; Marilee Adams refers to the judger vs. the learner mindsets; Carol Dweck refers to the fixed vs. the growth mindsets.&nbsp; Both agree that we typically have one dominant mindset (often the judger or the fixed mindset) and that with purposeful thought and practice we have the ability to choose our mindset, thus our reactions, choices and behaviors, in life situations.&nbsp; Understanding our dominant mindset, being aware of our typical attitudes or beliefs, being mindful of the power of our beliefs, and choosing to change our approach to situations can have a profound impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adams uses a great visual tool, the choice map.&nbsp; This map is an illustration of the paths a judger and a learner mindset take from the perspective of external circumstances to internal thoughts and reactions.&nbsp; As with many paths there comes a cross road, and the traveler has options or choices.&nbsp; &nbsp;With mindsets, this represents the opportunity to switch the internal dialogue from judger questions such as why am I such a failure, why do bad things always happen to me, or I’m not good enough to learner questions such as why am I reacting this way, what can I learn from this, and what could I do differently next time.&nbsp; These thoughts go very quickly, moment to moment, and we have the ability to switch thoughts from limiting beliefs to unlimited possibilities.&nbsp; Want to learn more?&nbsp; Watch Marilee Adams discuss the judger vs. the learner mindsets on you tube and you can download the choice map at&nbsp;<a href="http://inquiryinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://inquiryinstitute.com</a>.</p>



<p>Carol Dweck’s research led her to understanding the power of ‘not yet’.&nbsp; A fixed mindset believes intelligence is static, a growth mindset believes intelligence can be developed.&nbsp; A fixed mindset avoids challenges, gives up easily, ignores feedback, and feels threatened by others success.&nbsp; A growth mindset embraces challenges, persists despite setbacks, listens to and learns from feedback, and supports others successes.&nbsp; Success may not have happened ‘yet’, however it’s not a failure, it’s an opportunity to learn and grow.&nbsp; Her research reminds me of one of my favorite sayings ‘fail forward’, because failure is inevitable; what we choose to learn from, and do, as a result of that failure is our choice to own.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>A favorite movie of mine is A Knight’s Tale.&nbsp; I enjoy the story, the resilience of the characters, the comedic perspective, the music, and I have a crush on Paul Bettany.&nbsp; In the story, the main characters father, John Thatcher, tells his son to ‘change his stars and live a better life.’&nbsp; That’s mindset, choosing, despite external circumstances and internal dialogue, to have a passion for learning, growing and being your best self.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<strong>By Ellen I Lowery, D.V.M., PhD, M.B.A</strong>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>When I first joined industry I believed I had the perfect job.&nbsp; I was immersed in a mix of research, education and clinical work in an environment that met my core needs at the time – challenging work, the right geographic location and financial security with benefits!&nbsp; Honestly at that time in my life, just out of graduate school with a mountain of educational debt and a family to provide for, I just wanted a ‘good’ job and wasn’t really thinking about my long term career.&nbsp; A few years later, as corporate priorities shifted, I was faced with a career decision – stay in R&amp;D and shift my research focus, search for a different position within the company or look outside the company.&nbsp; I realized that I needed to take the lead in managing my career to be successful professionally and personally.&nbsp; I evolved from passively waiting to see what my manager thought would be my next role to actively learning about different roles and seeking new opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Career management can be thought of as the process by which we make reasoned, appropriate decisions about our work lives.&nbsp; It may seem that our careers are driven more by chance than ‘reasoned decisions’.&nbsp; This is where you take charge. Taking an active role in managing your career can be the difference between surviving a job and having a thriving career.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Some pearls for managing your career within a corporate environment include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start with your ‘why’.  Know what’s important to you in regards to your talents, interests and preferred lifestyle.  What are the reasons that you’ve chosen the company and your position?  This could range from needed a job with benefits to love the company values.  For example, with my first position I had the opportunity to join a company that didn’t require relocation (important for my family), offered a strong salary and benefits package (important for me to be able to care for my family and service my loan debt), had a position that matched my interests/strengths (important for me to feel fulfilled and challenged) and was a company that had a mission that matched my core values (important for my fit and values as a veterinarian).  </li>



<li>Think about what’s important to you both now and in the future and be willing to step outside your comfort zone.  Early in my career the ability to provide stability and care for my family was more important than climbing the corporate ladder.  After a few years I was ready personally and professionally for new challenges and also wanted career advancement.  I was willing to leave my role in R&amp;D and embrace opportunities on the commercial side of the business.  A great resource is the book Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway by Susan Jeffers.  She writes that one of the biggest reasons people don’t move ahead is the fear of making the wrong decision.  Flip this to thinking about your potential gain from making the right decision and be willing to fail forward.  If you make a mistake, it’s an opportunity to learn and grow. </li>



<li>Embrace both the objective and subjective levers of career management.  The objective components are things like the job position or duties (my first position as a scientist) and the subjective components are the feelings or values around that experience (exciting work, met personal values).  From this perspective, career management can involve changing the objective component (moving from scientist position to marketing manager position) and/or by modifying the subjective perception (saying I have to stay with company for financial reasons versus saying I choose to stay with the company because supporting my family is important to  me).  </li>



<li>Work with your manager and your network to learn about different positions.  If there’s a position you’re interested in, ask about the requirements for that position (skills, location, travel, etc.), evaluate if the position is a fit for you in terms of your career and your life goals and if so, let your interests be known and ask for opportunities to develop the needed skills.   </li>



<li>Adopt a learner mindset and frame your career in terms of work related experiences vs. specific positions.  Leaning in to opportunities builds your network and your skillset, both valuable in shaping your career.  Look for ways to enhance your career through opportunities within your company, such as leading a project or volunteering for a task force, or outside your company such as working with professional organizations (AAIV, AVMA, local VMA or shelter, school board, youth sports, 4H, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>Taking an active role in managing your career by understanding what you enjoy, what you’re good at and what really matters to you in work and in life will support a rewarding, successful career.</p>
