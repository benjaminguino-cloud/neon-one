<![CDATA[<p>At Destination: College, we believe that access to higher education is built through relationships, guidance, and sustained support. That belief is strengthened when partners step forward to invest in our students and their futures.</p>



<p>We are deeply grateful to the <strong>Thomas &amp; Agnes Carvel Foundation</strong> for awarding Destination: College a <strong>$15,000 grant</strong> to support our work with student-athletes as they navigate the college journey.</p>



<p>This generous investment helps power the personalized guidance our students rely on — from navigating the college application process to understanding financial aid, staying on track through senior year, and continuing support once they enroll in college. For our students, this support can be the difference between uncertainty and confidence, between starting college and staying the course.</p>



<p>The Carvel Foundation’s commitment reflects a shared belief in educational opportunity and long-term impact. Their support strengthens our ability to show up consistently for students and families, meet them where they are, and walk alongside them through one of the most important transitions of their lives.</p>



<p>As we close out the year, we are reminded that this work is only possible because of partners who believe in our mission — and a community of supporters who make it sustainable.</p>



<p>If you’re inspired by the Carvel Foundation’s generosity, we invite you to join them. A gift to our <strong>Year-End Campaign</strong> helps ensure Destination: College can continue supporting students this year and beyond.</p>



<p>Together, we can keep doors open — and help students walk confidently through them.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>More than 60 Destination: College senior student-athletes recently took one of the most important steps on their path toward college: completing the FAFSA.</p>



<p>It’s a detailed, high-stakes financial aid application that can feel overwhelming, especially for students navigating the process for the first time. But with the encouragement of their families, the guidance of our volunteers, and the steady support of their coaches and school, our seniors showed up ready—and they absolutely <em>crushed it.</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2714.png">

</p>



<p>
<strong>We couldn’t be prouder of their hard work and determination.</strong>
</p>



<p>Moments like these don’t happen by accident. They are the result of community: DC coaches who encourage their players, volunteers who sit beside students with patience and confidence, and families who show unwavering support. Together, they help our students take a step that can change the trajectory of their futures.</p>



<p>
<strong>As we near the end of the year, we’re inviting you to be part of this momentum.</strong>
</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As we close out 2025, we’re celebrating the remarkable achievements of our student-athletes — and the community that helps make every milestone possible.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DC_Year-End-Appeal-06.png">
<p>Take <strong>Joel Okine</strong>, who joined Destination: College as a high school student with big dreams and a drive to achieve them. With support from his mentors, Joel went on to earn an honors degree from Buffalo State College. Today, he’s paying that support forward as a mentor to younger DC student-athletes who are pursuing their own goals.</p>





<p>Or <strong>Teneisia Brown</strong>, who first came to DC as a 10th grader. After excelling as a Division I athlete and graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University, she is now pursuing her Master’s in Higher Education while leading the Providence College Women’s Basketball team — carrying forward the encouragement she once received.</p>
<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DC_Year-End-Appeal-07.png">



<p>Stories like these reflect the strength of our full continuum of programs.<br>Through <strong>Team Reads</strong>, we offer high-school athletes in the Mount Vernon City School District academic support and a positive, team-centered environment that keeps them engaged in school. Our <strong>Mentoring Program</strong> connects students with both caring adult mentors and peer mentors, helping them navigate academics, sports, and the transition to college with confidence. And in the <strong>Cooney College Center</strong>, students receive one-on-one support with college applications, financial aid, and campus visits — ensuring they’re prepared for every step ahead.</p>



<p>As we approach our <strong>20th anniversary in 2026</strong>, we’re not only reflecting on how far we’ve come — we’re building momentum for the next decade of student success. Your generosity makes that future possible. A year-end gift to Destination: College ensures that more students have the resources, relationships, and opportunities they need to succeed in college and beyond.</p>



<p>
<strong>Join us in investing in our students’ futures. Your support today opens doors for years to come.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>At Destination: College we love staying in touch and giving support to our alumni as they progress through college and beyond. Today we proudly launch a new and ongoing feature called Alumni Updates, highlighting the stories of Destination: College alumni now in College. For our first story, we proudly introduce you to Heily Gonzalez, who will be graduating from Cornell University in 2026. Heily stays in touch with Destination: College Board Member, volunteer and mentor Tracy McVey. Thank you to Tracy for initiating and facilitating this piece. We’ll let Heily tell you what she’s up to in her own words…read on!</p>



<p>“I am currently a senior at Cornell triple majoring in Government, Sociology, and American Studies with a minor in Law &amp; Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year has been a culmination of everything I’ve worked toward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve taken upper-level courses that deepen my interest in immigration, inequality, and public-interest law, and I’ve maintained strong academic standing while balancing several leadership and community roles on campus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I recently completed my term as President of the Dominican Students Association, and this is my fourth year in Cornell’s Black Ivy Pre-Law Society, where I serve as the Vice President of Academics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am also a member of the Sabor Latino Dance Ensemble, which has allowed me to stay connected to my culture while performing across campus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond campus involvement, I interned at Proskauer Rose LLP over the past two summers and gained hands-on legal experience through the Cornell Public Defender Program and Cornell Law School’s Asylum &amp; CAT Appellate Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These academic, leadership, and legal experiences have shaped my direction and strengthened my preparation for law school.</p>



<p>Short term, I am applying to law school with the goal of enrolling in Fall 2026. I hope to continue building on my legal experiences through internships, mentorship, and community work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long term, I plan to pursue a career in public-interest and immigration law, focusing on expanding access to justice for immigrant and first-generation communities.</p>



<p>I also plan to continue growing INSPIRE, the nonprofit that Maame Forson (Harvard ’25) and I co-founded to advance opportunities for first-generation high school students.”</p>



<p>We at Destination: College are all incredibly proud of Heily and her accomplishments thus far and are excited to follow and share in her journey.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Recently, over three exciting days, our <strong>Destination: College student-athletes</strong> took part in a series of <strong>college campus tours</strong>, visiting <strong>Manhattanville College</strong>, <strong>Mercy University</strong>, and <strong>Pace University</strong> — all guided by our Director of College Programs, Saskya Molina and Destination: College volunteers.</p>



<p>These visits are more than just tours — they’re a key part of our <strong>college readiness program</strong>, helping students imagine themselves on campus, connect their academic and athletic goals, and experience firsthand what college life can look like.</p>



<p>During the tours, students met with admissions counselors, explored classrooms, residence halls, and facilities, and even connected with <strong>DC alumni</strong> currently studying at <strong>Pace</strong> and <strong>Mercy</strong>. Hearing their stories and advice added an inspiring personal touch — showing our student-athletes that with dedication and support, their own college dreams are within reach.</p>



<p>At <strong>Destination: College</strong>, we believe that <em>exposure is empowerment</em>. Experiences like these help our students set goals, stay motivated, and understand the steps needed to succeed in higher education and beyond.</p>



<p>A heartfelt thank-you to <strong>Manhattanville College</strong>, <strong>Mercy University</strong>, and <strong>Pace University</strong> for welcoming our students — and to our incredible alumni for sharing their time and wisdom!</p>

<p>Last week, Destination: College hosted our dedicated volunteers for our annual <strong>Volunteer Breakfast</strong> at the Bronxville Field Club. The event was a chance to reconnect with the people who make our mission possible and to highlight the impact of volunteering.</p>



<p>
<strong>Highlights from the Breakfast</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A presentation by our Executive Director, Michele Roque discussing our mission, our programs, our goals and our successes.</li>



<li>Stories of student success reminded us of the power of consistency and encouragement.</li>



<li>Volunteers connected with one another sharing experiences and ideas.</li>



<li>Our team expressed gratitude and shared exciting goals for the year ahead.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Honoring Our Volunteers</strong>
</p>



<p>To every volunteer who gives their time to Destination: College: <strong>thank you.</strong>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of Volunteering</strong>
</p>



<p>Volunteering at Destination: College is about more than putting in hours — it’s about transformation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>For Our Student Athletes:</strong> Volunteers provide encouragement, academic guidance, and confidence-building support. That belief in a student’s potential often makes all the difference.</li>



<li>
<strong>For Our Volunteers:</strong> Many tell us they gain as much as they give — through meaningful relationships, personal growth, and the joy of seeing students succeed.</li>



<li>
<strong>For Our Community:</strong> Volunteers strengthen the entire Destination: College family by fostering connection, collaboration, and shared purpose.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Join Us</strong>
</p>



<p>The work of Destination: College is only possible because of our volunteers. Whether you’re interested in tutoring, mentoring, or supporting our programs in other ways, we’d love for you to get involved.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As summer winds down and the new school year begins, our Destination: College (DC) student-athletes are stepping back onto the fields, courts, and classrooms with fresh energy and determination. This time of year is always filled with excitement and possibility—new classes, new teammates, and new goals to chase both academically and athletically.</p>



<p>At DC, we know that balancing the demands of being a student-athlete takes discipline, resilience, and heart. Our students carry more than just the weight of textbooks and practice schedules; they also carry the dreams of attending college, to succeed at the highest level, and to inspire others who will follow in their footsteps.</p>



<p>This fall, we’re proud to watch as our 2025 Cooney Scholars begin their college careers and all of our DC student athletes who worked hard over the summer—whether through training, internships, or summer courses. Their commitment shows us that the values we emphasize—dedication, perseverance, and community—extend far beyond the game.</p>



<p>As the year ahead unfolds, DC will continue to provide the guidance, mentorship, and support our students need to succeed and persist. From SAT prep to college tours, from financial aid applications to tutoring and mentoring opportunities, we’re committed to ensuring that every student-athlete has the tools to succeed in the classroom.</p>



<p>We look forward to cheering on our athletes this season and celebrating their victories—big and small—along the way. Whether it’s earning a personal best, submitting a strong college application, or simply showing up with courage and grit, every step forward matters.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How You Can Help</h3>

<![CDATA[<p>Our 2025 graduates, now rising freshmen, are eagerly preparing to begin new adventures at their new colleges in the coming weeks. Each summer we attend a wonderful event to shop for free dorm supplies hosted by <a href="https://www.gradbag.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.gradbag.org/">Grad Bag</a>.</p>



<p>Grad Bag is a non-profit founded in 2012. They have provided dorm room essentials for more than 5,500 students and diverted nearly 170 tons of materials from the waste stream. Grad Bag visits college campuses to collect up donations of dorm supplies which are then distributed to students up and down the East Coast.</p>



<p>IT’s a great day for DC student athletes to shop among the stacks of comforters, pillows, sheets, shower caddies, mirrors, lamps and much more. We bring our student athletes by bus our volunteers meet us at the event to help transport all of the dorm merchandise back to Mount Vernon. There’s way too much stuff to fit on the bus!</p>



<p>Everyone is included. Students unable to to attend are invited to have family of a friend shop in their stead.</p>



<p>The photos tell the story! Below are photos of our group of very happy students, who just took one step closing to going to college! </p>

<p>The Cooney Scholarship Program at Destination: College is named in memory of Jeff Cooney, DC’s former board member who was unwavering in his dedication to our mission. Following Mr. Cooney’s untimely passing in 2018, all DC scholarships were named in his honor, ensuring that his legacy lives on through the achievements of our students.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By Board Chair Nancy McKenna</p>



<p>On a gorgeous June evening before a sellout crowd, Destination: College (DC) celebrated this year’s class of Cooney Scholars with a very special guest- legendary NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.&nbsp;Siwanoy Country Club proved a fitting venue to recognize the many who have made DC ‘s mission possible for over 19 years.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Cooney-Scholars-72-1024x483.png">NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell with the Class of 2025 Cooney Scholars



<p>A longtime resident of Bronxville, the Commissioner played football at Bronxville High School with Jeff Cooney, DC’s beloved former board member. Following Mr. Cooney’s untimely death in 2018, all DC scholarships were subsequently named in his&nbsp;honor.</p>



<p>Joined by members of the Cooney Family, DC celebrated the contributions of its many coaches, volunteers and generous supporters while acknowledging this year’s class of Cooney Scholars. They are 21 strong and members&nbsp;of 12 sports teams from all three of the high schools in Mount Vernon (Mount Vernon High School, STEAM Academy and the Denzel Washington School of the Arts). These individuals&nbsp;were selected&nbsp;based on&nbsp;academics, leadership, and grit.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DC_College-Acceptances-2025-683x1024.png">The complete list of DC College Acceptances for 2025



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Official105-1024x683.jpg">L-R: Commissioner Goodell, Cynthia Cooney, Chris Cooney, Jane Goodell and George Cooney



<p>The highlight of the evening was an interview with Commissioner Goodell by DC students, including&nbsp;five former, current and hopeful Cooney Scholars. The session was moderated by Mary Civiello, an Emmy Award winning journalist who is a longtime DC volunteer and supporter and who currently works as a communications coach for senior executives around the world.</p>

<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Official305-1024x791.png">DC Cooney Scholar panelists with the Commissioner.



<p>Questions posed by the students ranged from how the NFL works with players to enhance financial literacy, to the impact of coming from a political family on the Commissioner’s leadership style, to what advice he had for students trying to emulate that style and his success.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Official279-760x1024.png">Commissioner Goodell accepting a DC shirt from panelist Elijah Morris, who along with fellow DC alum Jaden Fearon, designed and produced the shirt.



<p>Every year, fueled by some 70 volunteers, DC works with 300 students both in high school and college. Academic assistance, mentoring and help with all aspects of college admissions, including financial aid, are key components of DC’s program. DC’s mission is to help students gain entry to the college best suited to their academic, financial and athletic needs. Board Chair Nancy McKenna expressed gratitude for the support of all in the room for helping DC achieve that mission and its goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you would like to join the DC family as a volunteer, &nbsp;please reach out to Executive Director Michele Roque at <a href="mailto:mroque@destinationcollegeny.org">mroque@destinationcollegeny.org</a> to be part of the fall programs !</p>

<![CDATA[<p>College Knowledge comprises two sessions of informal discussion for Destination: College graduating seniors and is part of our College Readiness program. The sessions takes place in the Cooney College Center each May. The goals of College Knowledge are to give real-world information about starting college; provide support and reassurance in a safe, nurturing environment; tackle impending challenges and changes that students may encounter; and provide relatable tools and skills for seniors to draw on.</p>



<p>This year the first session of College Knowledge was presented by Ms. Laura, our Director of College Success.</p>



<p>This session was focused on the concerns that the seniors may be having about going to college. For some this is about being away from home for the first time, for others it’s about making new friends, or getting used to being in a new and different environment, and for others it’s about doing well in their classes.</p>



<p>To break the ice, students were each given a balloon and a note card. On the notecard they anonymously write any fear or concern they have about going to college. They then placed the note into the ballon and inflated the balloon. Then the fun began as the balloons were tossed around College Center and finally randomly distributed amongst the students. Each student took it in turn to pop a balloon and read out loud the note inside. And then the students gave each other advice! The group was very insightful and articulate.  Each student-athlete encouraged the other to stay true to who they are and to go for their goals no matter what.</p>

<p>
<br>The second session of College Knowledge was all about perspective. This session was led by Ms. Laura and featured four Destination: College alums who have recently completed their freshman year at college. They shared their perspectives and experiences from their first year. Our graduating seniors listened intently. The alums talked about topics such as the importance of scheduling, writing tasks down, using google calendar and planning study groups ahead of time. They also talked about meeting new people and making friends, and how they had to step out of their comfort zone at times to do this.<br>
</p>

<p>The alums gave important advice such as “Don’t skip class” and “Communicating with professors is important.” They showed the seniors how to prioritize: Get work done before going out! And they reassured the seniors: College is hard and fun, but doable.</p>

<p>The final College Knowledge message to this year’s seniors was “Don’t forget DC is here for you!”.<br>Over the coming weeks our Cooney Scholarship winners will be assigned a mentor who will guide and support them through their college years. DC provides regular online meetings and seminars for our graduates to attend while away at college. Destination: College’s College Success program begins with our graduating seniors and carries through with our DC Alumni. Our retention rates speak for themselves. <a href="https://destinationcollegeny.org/our-impact/">https://destinationcollegeny.org/our-impact/</a> We are very excited to continue to work with the Class of 2025 as they begin their new chapters. Stay tuned!</p>

<strong>The Impact of the Cooney College Center and Cooney Scholarship Program at Destination: College</strong>
</p>



<p>At the heart of every transformative educational journey is a support system that believes in the potential of students. At Destination: College, the Cooney College Center and the Cooney Scholarship Program stand as powerful testaments to what is possible when young people are equipped with opportunity, mentorship, and financial support.</p>



<p>
<strong>A Hub for College Dreams: The Cooney College Center</strong>
</p>



<p>The Cooney College Center is more than just a physical space—it’s a beacon of hope and a launchpad for student success. Designed as a safe, welcoming environment, the Center provides critical college access resources for high school students. It offers academic support, personalized college counseling, application assistance, and workshops that demystify the entire college process.</p>



<p>What sets the Cooney College Center apart is its commitment to personalized attention. Students aren’t treated as numbers—they’re seen as individuals with unique goals, challenges, and dreams. The staff and volunteers walk side-by-side with students through every step of their college journey, fostering both capacity and confidence.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/March-Madness_2024-7.png">



<p>
<strong>Investing in Potential: The Cooney Scholarship Program</strong>
</p>



<p>While academic support is vital, financial barriers remain one of the most significant obstacles to college access and college success. The Cooney Scholarship Program directly addresses these challenges by providing funding to deserving students who have demonstrated perseverance, promise, and a commitment to higher education.</p>



<p>This scholarship isn’t just a financial boost—it’s a powerful vote of confidence. For some recipients, the Cooney Scholarship is the bridge between ambition and achievement. It empowers students to thrive in their first year of college, knowing that they have a community encouraging and advocating their success.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Alumni-Party-25_Jessica-Benjamin_Charlotte-Goncalves_SUNY-Albany-1.png">



<p>
<strong>A Ripple Effect of Opportunity</strong>
</p>



<p>Together, the Cooney College Center and the Cooney Scholarship Program exemplify the mission of Destination: College—to ensure that every student, regardless of background or income, has the tools and support to pursue higher education. These initiatives don’t just change individual lives; they uplift families, strengthen communities, and build a more equitable future.</p>



<p>As we look toward a world that increasingly values education, innovation, and resilience, the work being done at Destination: College is not only timely—it’s essential.</p>

<p>
<strong>2025 Cooney Scholars</strong>
</p>



<p>Our 2025 Cooney Scholars will be announced at <strong>The Best Night of the Year celebration on June 11, from 6:00PM to 8:00PM at the Siwanoy Country Club</strong>. The event honors the achievements of our student-athletes, dedicated coaches, passionate volunteers, and the exceptional 2025 Cooney Scholars.</p>



<p>This year’s celebration will feature a <strong>special guest appearance by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell,</strong> a longtime supporter of Destination: College and a former football teammate of the late Jeff Cooney at Bronxville High School. Commissioner Goodell will participate in a live interview conducted by members of the 2025 Cooney Scholarship class, moderated by esteemed broadcaster and longtime DC volunteer Mary Civiello.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>After months of hard work Destination: College student athlete seniors are now making their commitments to colleges! The Cooney College Center is buzzing with excitement and anticipation for what’s next. Their journey through the Destination: College program over the past two years has been an ongoing commitment of their time and energy to all that we offer; Team Reads, mentoring, tutoring, attending The Cooney College Center and hours and hours of diligent hard work.</p>



<p>We have a time-honored tradition at DC to celebrate every time a student-athlete makes the commitment to their choice of college. How do we do that? We gift every senior with a sweatshirt from their college! College-branded merchandise holds a special place in the hearts of students, serving as a&nbsp;tangible representation&nbsp;of their pride and sense of belonging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tradition of wearing college-branded sweatshirts is rooted in a blend of displaying school spirit, fostering a sense of community, and inclusivity.</p>



<p>At the Destination: College Cooney College Center this meaningful tradition marks the next chapter for our student-athletes and we couldn’t be prouder of them. Below are photos of our latest sweatshirt presentations!</p>

<strong>Loan Counseling Session for Seniors</strong>
</p>



<p>This past week we hosted a loan counseling session in the Cooney College Center for Destination: College seniors. Loan counseling provides crucial information and support in navigating what can be a complicated and confusing process. </p>



<p>Destination: College volunteers have vast experience and a deep understanding of this process. Their guidance and support of our student-athletes is invaluable.</p>

<p>This past Monday was a big day for one group of Destination: College Juniors. They took part in our Spring 2025 College Trip! This year the group visited Siena College and University at Albany – State University of New York. </p>



<p>Everyone met promptly for a 7.30am bus departure there was excitement for the day ahead. Accompanied by Ms. Michele, Ms. Laura and Ms. Linda, the students explored both campuses, participated in information sessions, viewed a dorm room, and attended campus walking tours.</p>



<p>It was also a great opportunity to meet up with several DC alumni who are students at either Siena or Albany. Our Juniors were eager to learn first hand from the DC alumni, who shared their experiences and answered questions.</p>



<p>The students also attended a <a href="https://www.suny.edu/attend/academics/eop/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.suny.edu/attend/academics/eop/">Higher Educational Opportunity Program</a> (HEOP) information session led by three DC alumni. This program has proven to be an important resource for students.</p>



<p>Everyone agreed that the day was extremely rewarding and a lot of fun – despite the early start!</p>

<strong>March Madness Update</strong>
</p>



<p>During our annual March Madness, we welcome Juniors to the Cooney College Center for the first time. This year the sessions have been very popular and well attended. Our second session was led by our Director of College Success and focused on essay writing. For many students March Madness is a first exposure to “what’s next” in the college application process. With one more March Madness session to go, we are excited to begin the journey with the promising young women and men. </p>

<p>It was wonderful to see thirty eight Destination: College alums at our Alumni Reunion Party on Tuesday, January 7th in the Mount Vernon High School Cafeteria. All were excited to connect with their mentors and check in, others were happy to see their friends and catch up. The energy in the room was upbeat and the chatter was non-stop!</p>



<p>Things kicked off early with ten alums arriving at the Cooney College Center before the party started to work on their FAFSA applications with DC volunteers. It’s great that alums continue to access DC resources and look to us for guidance.</p>



<p>Eleven mentors attended the party, eager to check in with their mentees and hear how things are going. See below, Tyriek with mentor Bob Dennan, Ines with mentor Anne Angevine, mentor Phil Cannella and Rachel.</p>

<p>We loved catching up with two juniors who will finish college early (pictured below with Laura Amigone, Director of College Success, who stands on the right) – Laila Issa (In the middle of the photo) who will finish her undergraduate studies this spring, and start med school in the fall at Sophie Davis Medical School at City College, and business major, Nico Zaffuto (left in the photo) who will graduate a semester early (Fall 2025) at the Honors Program at Iona College.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DC continues to support and stay connect with ALL our graduates – including students who transition to the workforce. It was great to see Jayden and Demarley (photo below), who are working as assistant teachers in a special education classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Tribute to Linda D’Arcy</strong>
</p>



<p>Laura Amigone, our Director of College Success, led a heartfelt and well-deserved tribute to DC former staff member and now volunteer, Ms. Linda. Ms. Laura spoke of her own enduring relationship with Ms. Linda, how Ms. Linda brought her into the DC world and how much Ms. Linda had taught her when she first came to Destination: College. Ms. Michele, our Executive Director (not pictured), went on to discuss Ms. Linda’s many years as Director of College Access and  Ms. Linda’s kind and caring approach which endures as she  continues to work with Destination: College as a volunteer in our Cooney College Center. Ms. Laura then invited students to say a few words about their experiences with Ms. Linda.</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Alumni-Party-1-7-25-6698.png">



<p>Kaseem Miller (below, second from left) offered Ms. Linda his heartfelt thanks to his mentor for always being there for him since he was 16! (Kaseem is now 26) Kaseem described Ms. Linda as <em>“Someone to call to talk through things”</em>, helping him get his internship at Pepsi, which he has since turned into a full time job.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://destinationcollegeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Alumni-Party-1-7-25-6706.png">



<p>Thank you to all who attended. We think you’ll agree that the 2025 Alumni Reunion Party was a wonderful success! Scroll below to see more photos. </p>



<p>
<strong>Here’s what some of the alums had to say:&nbsp;</strong>

<p>
<em>“Love my campus, and can’t wait to go back!”</em> <br>Stephany (SUNY Oswego) , Aurora, Pariz, and Merissa (all at Siena College)</p>



<p>

<![CDATA[<p>In May, we conducted four College Knowledge sessions for our 2023 graduates. The sessions were led by Linda D’Arcy, Director of College Access, and Laura Amignone, Director of College Success. A few of our many impressive alumni returned to share their personal experiences about succeeding in college. Our alumni chatted for over an hour and provided invaluable advise for our seniors and much gratitude to DC for our support and guidance. </p>



<p>
<strong>Taylor Bennet:</strong>
</p>



<p>DC provided me with so much. I remember when I first sought out DC, I didn’t know what I was walking into, but this is a family, helping me with financial aid to pay for school, helping me get stuff for my dorm room. Ms. Linda and Ms. Laura help you stay updated on everything …</p>



<p>
<strong>Paige Loague:</strong>
</p>



<p>DC sends constant reminders. These are things that aren’t right in your face, your peers don’t get these reminders, but you are getting the reminder to go do it. Book stipends, they’re there for those expensive books. DC really helps, They are genuine good people who want to see you win. Especially if you go away, you may feel on your own, but they are here with you every step of the way, and then one day you’ll be up here giving advice.</p>



<p>
<strong>Leni Marilejos:</strong>
</p>



<p>DC is a great support system. DC supported me so much throughout my application process, not just with the FAFSA, but actually pushing me to do it – even schools that you were scared to apply to, and help you- even the mentors, they check in with you monthly. I really enjoy having my mentor ask me how I’m doing and talk with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Final sum up:</p>



<p>What you wish you knew?</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Going to be ok!” If anxious about going to new school, new environment, it will be daunting, but it will ok – everyone will be as new as you are.&nbsp;</li>



<li>“College is going to be hard, but don’t let it break you”</li>



<li>“Don’t be afraid to be you; Go on that campus on be your greatest self”</li>
</ol>

<![CDATA[<p>One year ago our Destination: College community was celebrating the Mount Vernon Knights on their NYS Section 1 Basketball Championship win.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2023 and March Madness took on a new level of celebration for DC! Jeff Cooney Memorial Scholar ’18, Demetre Roberts, had a starring role with the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights in a historic upset of #1 seed Purdue University in the first round of the NCAA tournament. While FDU did not move past the second round against Florida Atlantic, Demetre’s exceptional skills were on full display as the top scorer for FDU in that game. What a story!</p>



<p>Demetre joined Destination: College in the summer of 7th grade and worked closely with our dedicated volunteers throughout high school to excel academically and meet the eligibility requirements for collegiate recruitment. We are so proud to have been part of his team and for all that he has accomplished.</p>



<p>This short video sharing the arc of his journey from high school, to Division 2 basketball powerhouse Saint Thomas Aquinas, to FDU to earn a graduate degree, to the NCAA tournament, is worth the watch! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPmAIAbH8I0">Click here!</a>

<![CDATA[<p>As announced to the Destination: College community Suzanne McCann, our Executive Director who  served DC with tremendous commitment and skill since 2014, has decided to step down at the end of this school year. After an extensive search, the Board of Destination: College is thrilled to announce their unanimous selection of Michele Roque to fill the position of Executive Director, effective July 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michele comes to Destination: College with an abiding commitment to its mission to make college a reality for our students. Michele has a deep understanding of DC having been the Program Head for Girls Basketball for three years. This past year, Michele volunteered her time and talents to our Cooney College Center. Michele is a proud graduate of Mount Vernon High School, has a BA from SUNY Binghamton and a Master of Arts in Literature from Mercy College, where she is an adjunct professor of English. She resides in Pelham, NY and her civic involvement is extensive. She is a past president of the Pelham Education Foundation, the Pelham PTA Council, and the Pelham School Board Citizens Nominating Committee, among other activities. Michele also has considerable experience as an executive in the retail industry, working at Polo Jeans and Armani Exchange. We are thrilled to officially welcome Michele to our DC family and to start our next chapter under her capable hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Michele will officially take her position on July 1, you will be seeing her in the hallways of MVHS for the next few months as she begins to learn the ropes from Suzanne. Please feel free to introduce yourselves and welcome Michele to our community! We will be honoring Suzanne for her many contributions to Destination: College at our June 14 dinner at the Bronxville Field Club. We hope you will join us to toast Suzanne for all that she has accomplished.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>20+ Destination: College senior Student Athletes from Mount Vernon CSD NY visited Siena College and University at Albany on November 11th.For many, it was the first time on a college tour.  The opportunity to visit a campus with a group of classmates and friends at this scale is a game-changer.  It was rewarding to hear how many students planned to add Siena College, University at Albany, or both to their Common Application.Mobilizing a group this large takes a lot of effort and is truly worth the commitment.</p>

<p>Destination: College/Mount Vernon CSD Student-Athletes enjoyed an INFORMATIVE and spirited afternoon at the Regeneron campus. The Regeneron team spoke about their college and career paths, creating opportunities, and took time to learn about each student’s goals. We LOVED seeing the labs and learning about the expansive of scope of innovation, funding, and logistics to get a drug to market. A special thank you to Volunteer NY! for coordinating our 3rd Annual workshop with Regeneron and Destination: College.</p>
