<p>In May and June 2025, ASISTA joined partners at Boston College School of Law, Harbor COV, and Tahirih to submit an amicus briefs to the First and Fourth Circuit Courts of Appeals in cases challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship. ASISTA and partners highlighted the importance of maintaining a preliminary injunction against implementing the order. If the order were implemented, many immigrant mothers of U.S.-born children would only be able to prove their child’s citizenship by submitting documentation about the child’s father’s immigration status. For survivors of intimate partner violence, just knowing the need for this documentation could make it difficult or impossible to leave the abusive relationship. For survivors of sexual assault or trafficking, contacting the perpetrator for the paperwork could put them and their families in immediate physical danger. Using real-life examples, the brief illustrates the stakes if immigrant parents were forced to choose between maintaining their safety and establishing their children’s rights. It urges the court not let this become reality. Read the First Circuit Brief, <em>Doe v. Trump</em>, <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/court-stamped_1st-Cir.-DV-SA-Imm-Orgs-Amicus-Brief-in-Birthright-Citizenship-Case_Final_5.28.25.pdf">here</a>; read the Fourth Circuit Brief, <em>Casa, Inc., et al. v. Trump</em>, <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/To-File-CA4_FINAL-Brief-of-Amici-Nonprofit-Orgs-Serving-Immigrant-Survivors-Disclosure-Form.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>On March 14, 2025, President Trump attempted to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify carrying out deportations without the due process of immigration proceedings. Since then, multiple federal courts have ruled the invocation was unlawful, but the government continues to fight for its usage, including before the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 16, 2025, the Supreme Court maintained a temporary prohibition on the deportations planned in Texas and sent the issue back to the lower courts. ASISTA celebrates the positive rulings but notes with condemnation that the push against them is ongoing. Check ASISTA’s alert: <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Alien-Enemies-Act-Alert-May-29.-2025.pdf">The Fight to Protect Survivors from the Alien Enemies Act Continue.</a>

<![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Oct. 28, AILA, ASISTA, and ICWC submitted a joint amicus brief to the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, regarding the proper analysis USCIS should use to assess whether a crime underlying a U visa petition is “qualifying criminal activity.” The complainant in the case had been the victim of a strong arm robbery during which a felonious assault also occurred, but USCIS denied relief based on very narrow and stringent readings of the law. Drawing on a prior ASISTA brief, the amici argued for a more flexible category-based approach to the qualifying crime analysis and criticized the elements-only approach the agency typically employs. Should the lawsuit succeed, the way USCIS analyzes all U visa crimes could be improved and broadened so that more survivors can obtain the protections they need and deserve.

<![CDATA[<p>Here at ASISTA, we share your sadness, outrage, and deep concern about what the future holds. We have also been preparing for this possible outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we process the elections results and continue to strategize, here are some things we know for sure:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Immigrant survivors have the right to apply for protections</strong> enshrined in our immigration laws, VAWA, and the TVPA, <strong>despite the avowed intention of the incoming administration</strong> to reduce or eliminate those forms of relief.</li>



<li>
<strong>Our unwavering commitment to equity, justice, and dignity for all people is only strengthened </strong>by this setback. We are <strong>more dedicated than ever </strong>to fighting for safety and justice for immigrant survivors.</li>



<li>
<strong>We exist in community with you, </strong>our members, our supporters, and all of our partners, and we are committed to supporting this community in the days to come. <strong>We are grateful for you:</strong> for all that you do for immigrant survivors and for always standing with us.</li>



<li>
<strong>We have faced attacks on the rights of survivors before, </strong>and we have staunchly defended immigrant survivors’ rights to safety and justice without interference.</li>



<li>Our resolve is strong, and <strong>we will continue to fight on behalf of immigrant survivors–because the stakes are high, because people are counting on us, because it’s the right thing to do, and because we are ASISTA.</strong>
</li>



<li>
<strong>
<em>Immigrant survivors of violence need all of our support now, more than ever.</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside you and many across the country, we are continuing to breathe deep and dig deep. We are steadfast in pursuit of our vision that immigrants live in a just world free from violence. We encourage you to rest and take care of yourselves and each other, which we are striving to do as well. We’re in this for the long haul…. and we hope that you are too.</p>



<p>In the days ahead, we will continue to share guidance about the best ways to advance the rights of immigrant survivors in this shifting landscape. As political realities continue to unfold in the days and weeks ahead… we at ASISTA are here, standing with immigrant survivors–and grateful that you are by our side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In solidarity,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By Cristina Velez, Veronica Sainz, and Kirsten Rambo</p>



<p>Thirty years ago, the landmark Violence Against Women Act was signed into law, marking a giant leap forward in the struggle to end gender-based violence (GBV). Today, as we celebrate this milestone anniversary, we do so in the midst of an election season unfortunately marked by dangerous rhetoric that reminds us just how much further we must go to achieve racial and gender justice. For many, including immigrant survivors of GBV, these tired tropes are far more than just words: they have real and dangerous consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retrograde narratives about gender, race, and immigrants portend failed policies that deepen inequalities. Back in 1992, Los Angeles police officers were acquitted for the infamous beating of Rodney King. In what came to be known as “<a href="https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/quayle-murphy-brown-speech-text-2/">the Murphy Brown speech</a>,” then-Vice President Dan Quayle attributed the resulting civil unrest not to a sense of collective outrage and despair borne of centuries of racial violence and injustice–but to the breakdown of the traditional family structure and the “narcotic of welfare.” He ended his speech by railing against the depiction of a single working woman’s choice to become a mother, in the popular television show “Murphy Brown.” In the years that followed, during the Clinton administration, sweeping rewrites of welfare, criminal, and immigration laws ushered in a long period of backlash against America’s changing demographics, leading to our current <a href="https://www.georgetownpoverty.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LastingLegacyExclusion-Aug2021.pdf">broken systems</a> of care and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, current Republican Vice-Presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s past comments echo those of Quayle. In public statements from 2021, Mr. Vance complained that the nation’s problems stemmed from a proliferation of “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5051873/the-family-politics-behind-j-d-vances-childless-cat-ladies-comment">childless cat-ladies</a>;” referred to unwanted pregnancies resulting from rape or incest as “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-donald-trump-women-womens-issues-violent-marriages-abortion-1926228">inconveniences</a>;” and suggested that children benefit when <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jd-vance-suggests-people-in-violent-marriages-shouldnt-get-divorced/">parents remain in unhappy, even violent, marriages</a>. Through such statements as well as his policy preferences, Mr. Vance makes it clear that he idealizes childbearing within heterosexual marriage–no matter the danger–as the solution to various social and economic ills, while degrading and punishing other types of households and families.</p>



<p>We know, however, that benefits predicated on marriage only <em>deepen </em>the isolation of survivors and trap them in violent homes. This recognition, in fact, was the root of the landmark, bipartisan VAWA legislation and later, the development of the U nonimmigrant visa. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499891/">Researchers</a> have found that a decline in the marriage rate, better access to services for survivors, and improvements in the economic status of women have actually contributed to a decline in the national rate of nonfatal domestic violence.</p>



<p>Facts like these appear to matter little to those pushing narratives that seek to degrade and dehumanize. Racist, xenophobic, and misogynist messaging may be heightened during election season, as candidates seek to mobilize votes by whipping up fear of fabricated scapegoats and bogeymen. The consequences can be profound, threatening immigrant survivors’ safety and very existence in this country. During the prior administration, vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric coupled with increased and arbitrary enforcement had palpable consequences, causing immigrant survivors <a href="https://www.tahirih.org/pubs/may-2019-advocate-survey-immigrant-survivors-fear-reporting-violence/#:~:text=In%20May%202019%2C%20the%20Tahirih,to%20court%20to%20get%20help.">to fear coming forward</a> to report violence against them and obtain services that could have helped them to get safe. In recent weeks, the town of Springfield, Ohio has been harmed by the knowingly false allegations of the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates that Haitian immigrants in that community were eating the pets of their neighbors. Absurd? Of course. But the words have remarkable power nonetheless, and have led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5114047/springfield-ohio-haitian-migrants-trump-safety-concerns">bomb threats that resulted in the closure of schools and city buildings and the canceling of public events.</a> Words were enough to disrupt an entire city, and cause the local Haitian community to consider leaving despite their legal, protected status. When a comedian at Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden rally <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9jj2g75q4o">referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage,”</a> his words undermined the worth of an entire community. Other rally speakers went on to repeat harmful stereotypes about Black, Latino, Jewish, and Palestinian people, perpetuating misunderstanding and fear of others. At the same time, vulgar social media posts sexualizing Vice President Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have become a popular tool of their political opponents, in an attempt to deny these women their dignity and accomplishments.</p>



<p>As hateful, fear-mongering rhetoric continues to ramp up this election season, consider the impact of these words on immigrant survivors of GBV. Through media feeds and informal networks, the echoes of these attacks reverberate loudly with immigrant survivors, who are reminded regularly that their safety in this country is far from guaranteed, and may well wonder: <em>If this is how they treat people with status and power, what will they do to us? </em>At ASISTA, we celebrate the tremendous, lifesaving impact of VAWA, and we recommit ourselves to the challenge of ensuring that immigrant survivors find safety and justice in this country, rather than cowardly, dangerous rhetoric that demeans us all.</p>

<strong>LGBTQ+ Immigrant Survivors at Greater Risk</strong>
</p>



<p>At ASISTA, we see all too often how LGBTQ+ immigrant survivors of violence are subject to increased vulnerability on the path to safety and justice in the US. Homophobia and transphobia, whether “casual” or institutionalized, result in additional barriers to services, decreased access to justice, and a greater risk of experiencing violence for already-traumatized immigrant survivors. Now, a powerful new report just released by Immigration Equality, the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), and Human Rights First (HRF) details grossly unjust conditions with CBP and ICE detention for LGBTQ and HIV-positive people. According to the report, <a href="https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/-hu6nned5p2gl1U-Q1wvUmTwXWK3JQUMrK6bAVR44Zs=/NNc9dF6fquG0DRNeEKdZYYa4V8qy823_nkkZFUi_n9Q=">“<strong>
<em>No Human Being Should Be Held Here”: The Mistreatment of LGBTQ and HIV-Positive People in Federal Immigration Jails,</em>
</strong>
</a> “these conditions routinely include high rates of physical and sexual violence, improper and prolonged solitary confinement, and inadequate medical care.” For survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), experiencing detention and otherwise navigating the US’s byzantine immigration system while also enduring heightened risks of discrimination, abuse, and neglect based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity only further compound existing trauma.</p>



<p>As June draws to a close and many corporations prepare to shelve their rainbow flags and themed merchandise until next year’s Pride celebration, we urge our community to honor Pride’s multiple meanings. The celebration that Pride represents–of strength, resistance, resilience, and the hard-fought gains toward a more just world for people of all genders and sexual orientations–is undeniably valuable. But headlines from <a href="https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/-hu6nned5p2gl1U-Q1wvUmTwXWK3JQUMrK6bAVR44Zs=/NNc9dF6fquG0DRNeEKdZYTnms_VuvXyOXdSi0Zya5T4=">around the country</a> and <a href="https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/-hu6nned5p2gl1U-Q1wvUmTwXWK3JQUMrK6bAVR44Zs=/NNc9dF6fquG0DRNeEKdZYdYndQsg5hSkW2vzmcY3Ag0=">around the world</a> regularly remind us that these battles are far from over–and that Pride also represents an urgent, unrelenting call for safety and justice for LGBTQ+ people. As hateful rhetoric and attacks against immigrants and LGBTQ+ individuals continue to mount, we thank you for joining us in the ongoing fight for dignity, rights, and liberty for LGBTQ+ immigrant survivors of violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Denounces President Biden’s Dangerous Border Proclamation</strong>
</p>



<p>Today, President Biden issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/06/04/a-proclamation-on-securing-the-border/#:~:text=Section%201.,time%20on%20June%205%2C%202024">proclamation</a> to “secure the border” between the US and Mexico, to take effect at midnight tonight. This action, unfortunately, will accomplish just the opposite, sowing chaos and further compounding the trauma of those who arrive here urgently seeking safety. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/deterrence-immigration-us-border-policy/674457/">Deterrence policies like these have resoundingly failed at their stated aims</a>, and this proclamation will have devastating effects.</p>



<p>Survivors of violence and their children—who have been traumatized in their home country and, often, on the perilous journey to the US as well—will suffer particular harm as a result of this policy, in direct contradiction to President Biden’s frequently stated concern for victims of violence. A notably cruel feature of this new policy provides that only those who affirmatively express their fear of torture or persecution or desire to apply for asylum will be provided the opportunity to apply. The countless traumatized individuals who do not know to announce their fear immediately, without ever being asked, will be turned away to face additional danger. Historically marginalized and under-resourced communities and people, including survivors of color and LGBTQI+ survivors, always bear these life-threatening burdens disproportionately, and this time will be no different.</p>



<p>The proclamation outlines a set of draconian measures that are triggered by a numerical cap of individuals seeking to enter the US. Intentionally choosing a cap that is well below current numbers of arriving migrants—and an even lower numerical threshold to pause the order—ensures that thousands of arriving migrants will be turned away. In the meantime, numbers of those awaiting entry will rise, while access to safety and basic services for those waiting become increasingly, and dangerously, out of reach.</p>



<p>There are orderly ways to welcome new arrivals and assess their needs. By choosing instead to turn traumatized people away, denying them their human right to seek safety here, this administration chooses further harm to those most in need of critical protection. We urge the administration to reverse course immediately and instead invest in more effectively receiving and processing the cases of people seeking asylum.</p>



<p>Kirsten Rambo, Executive Director of ASISTA, notes, “Every person deserves safety and dignity, no matter where we are born. While this administration tragically mimics the cruel and ineffective policies of the prior one, we at ASISTA will continue pushing relentlessly for policies that advance the dignity, safety, and justice that survivors of gender-based violence and their children deserve.”</p>



<p>Established in 2008, ASISTA is a national leader in the movement for safety and justice for immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. ASISTA’s founders helped write the immigration provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (TVPA), affording legal status to hundreds of thousands of survivors and their children since 1994. With over 2,500 members nationwide, ASISTA’s work is focused on 1) providing expert case consultation, training, and resources to attorneys and advocates navigating the complex immigration system on behalf of survivors of gender-based violence, including intervening in specific cases as needed; 2) pushing for federal, state and local policies that ensure safety and justice for immigrant survivors; and 3) coordinating lawsuits to prevent the government from unfairly deporting survivors of violence.

</p>



<p>
<a href="">
</a>Dear Members,</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 31, 2024, USCIS published its <a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%7B%7BemailTrackingId%7D%7D&amp;%7B%7BsecureId%7D%7D&amp;linkId=553074&amp;targetUrl=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/31/2024-01427/us-citizenship-and-immigration-services-fee-schedule-and-changes-to-certain-other-immigration">Final Rule Adjusting the USCIS Fee Schedule</a>. The new regulation, which goes into effect on April 1, 2024, is a significant victory for immigrants applying for survivor-based benefits. ASISTA and our partners pushed for the rule to be as expansive as possible in its humanitarian fee exemptions, as part of our ongoing advocacy for improved safety, stability, and legal access for immigrant survivors. We applaud USCIS and DHS for hearing us and recognizing that survivors often experience extreme economic difficulties that should not prevent their access to justice. This final rule takes an important step by codifying and expanding fee exemptions for survivors and other vulnerable groups, ensuring that cost is not a barrier in the pursuit of lawful status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage attorneys to take the time to review the final rule to understand how it will benefit their clients, and consider participating in the <a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%7B%7BemailTrackingId%7D%7D&amp;%7B%7BsecureId%7D%7D&amp;linkId=553065&amp;targetUrl=https://www.uscis.gov/outreach/upcoming-national-engagements/uscis-issues-final-rule-to-adjust-certain-immigration-and-naturalization-fees">USCIS National Engagement on the rule</a>, happening Feb. 22, 2024. Here are some of the important changes that will impact immigrant survivors applying for benefits:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>Immigrant survivors of violence will benefit enormously&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>from ample exemptions to USCIS filing fees.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final rule codifies fee exemptions for most humanitarian-related forms of relief and<em> </em>provides additional fee exemptions for certain immigration benefit requests <em>beyond the initial humanitarian related filing</em>. These exemptions are true exemptions and do not require submission of a fee waiver request. For example, under the new rule, all forms associated with an application for T nonimmigrant status, including Form I-192 waiver applications and Form I-765 work permit applications, are fee-exempt through final adjudication of the Form I-485. Other applicants who will benefit similarly include VAWA self-petitioners and their derivatives, U-visa applicants, Special Immigrant Juveniles, conditional residents applying for a waiver of Form I-751 based on battery or extreme cruelty, Special Immigrant Afghan or Iraqi Interpreters or Translators and other vulnerable applicants. Practitioners can find the complete list of the recently codified additional fee exemptions in the final rule in Table 5C <a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%7B%7BemailTrackingId%7D%7D&amp;%7B%7BsecureId%7D%7D&amp;linkId=553070&amp;targetUrl=https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-01427/page-6227">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>New, higher fees may still impact survivors&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>who apply for non-survivor-based immigration benefits.</strong>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survivors pursuing a non-survivor-based immigration option that will not be fee-exempt should be advised that the new rule may increase the cost of that application. Such applicants may choose to file before the rule takes effect or prepare for the additional expense if they must file after April 1, 2024. Practitioners should be aware of the following notable changes in the final rule:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applications for naturalization, even if filed by survivors, are not fee-exempt, but will have expanded fee reduction options.</li>



<li>Benefit requests submitted electronically will save $50.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fee waivers will continue to be available for many applicants who do not qualify for an exemption, but receive mean-tested public benefits, have income at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or who demonstrate financial hardship.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>Many forms will be revised and prior editions&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>should not be used after April 1, 2024.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%7B%7BemailTrackingId%7D%7D&amp;%7B%7BsecureId%7D%7D&amp;linkId=553064&amp;targetUrl=https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/frequently-asked-questions-on-the-uscis-fee-rule">FAQ</a> featured on the USCIS website lists the revised forms that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, along with the new fees. USCIS will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1, 2024 to June 3, 2024, as long as they were filed with the correct updated fee. Please note that certain forms related to non-immigrant and immigrant workers as well as orphan petitions <strong>will not</strong> be granted a grace period.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#340bc9">
<strong>Celebrate but stay informed!</strong>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASISTA and our partners fought hard for the new rule to acknowledge and alleviate the special financial stressors that exist for survivors. We are extremely pleased with the decision to have the final rule exempt the full suite of U, T, and VAWA-related applications in particular. We will continue to monitor USCIS as it transitions to the final rule in the coming weeks and months. We hope you will help by drawing our attention to any areas of concern in implementation. As with any advocacy efforts, it is critical to stay informed and proactive about adapting to changes. We appreciate your continued commitment to advocating for immigrant survivors and we at ASISTA remain steadfast in our support of your valuable work.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: </strong>February 6, 2024</p>



<p>
<strong>Contact: </strong>Cristina Velez, <a href="mailto:kirsten@asistahelp.org">cristina@asistahelp.org</a>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Urges Senators to Reject Border Deal that Exposes Immigrant Survivors to Further Trauma, Hardship, and Violence</strong>
</p>



<p>After months of opaque negotiations, a small group of senators released a<a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/emergency_national_security_supplemental_bill_text.pdf"> bill</a> on Sunday, February 4, 2024 that would eviscerate access to asylum, create a dangerous new statutory authority to expel asylum-seekers from the United States, expand detention, and limit review of decisions. The bill includes some positive changes, such as protections for Afghan arrivals and increased funding for representation and resettlement.<strong> </strong>If passed, however, this legislation would condemn immigrant survivors fleeing gender-based violence to further harm, trauma, and potentially death. ASISTA urges the Senate and White House to immediately reverse course and reject this harmful bill.</p>



<p>ASISTA is deeply concerned by several of the bill’s provisions that would curtail the rights of immigrant survivors seeking asylum. First, the bill’s new fast-track asylum process, which contemplates an asylum decision within 90 days of arrival in the United States, sets immigrant survivors up to fail. No asylum seeker should be rushed through the dizzyingly complex U.S. asylum system, particularly as it is widely known that trauma impairs the ability of survivors to tell a linear story under the immense pressure of a formal proceeding. Immigrant survivors need support to heal and to find safe shelter, food, clothing, and medical treatment for themselves and their children. They need access to trauma-informed and language-accessible mental health professionals and legal representatives. Although the bill includes increased funding for representation of unaccompanied minors and persons deemed not competent, the vast majority of immigrant survivors would be left out in the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also strongly oppose the bill’s expansion of detention and surveillance of asylum seekers. Both of these provisions would expose immigrant survivors to additional harms and inhibit their ability to access confidential, community-based services. Such intrusive monitoring is stigmatizing, and would be highly re-traumatizing to immigrant survivors who have had their movements tracked by abusers, or who have suffered surveillance by the government in their country of origin because of their religion, political views, or LGBTQ+ identity. Moreover, under this bill, immigrant survivors facing life-or-death situations would have fewer appellate protections than plaintiffs in small claims court. This is also unacceptable. The bill provides virtually no time to file appeals. Even for those few who could file timely appeals, in all but the most extraordinary cases, the only review available is by an appellate panel of three more asylum officers. ASISTA opposes the virtually unchecked discretionary authority and evisceration of judicial review contemplated by this bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Kirsten Rambo, Executive Director of ASISTA, states, </strong>
</p>



<p>“ASISTA stands with immigrant survivors of gender-based violence by opposing this legislation. The restrictions on asylum contained in this bill leave immigrant survivors <em>more </em>vulnerable to violence, and separated from the trauma-informed, community-based supports and representation that are crucial to healing and the ability to present claims for much-needed relief. Despite some of the positive aspects of the bill, we oppose any deal that leaves immigrant survivors suffering, isolated, and at greater risk of further harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASISTA urges its members, partners, and everyone who cares about survivors to join us and countless other immigrant rights organizations in moving swiftly to oppose this bill.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&nbsp;###</p>



<p>Established in 2008, ASISTA is a national leader in the movement for safety and justice for immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. ASISTA’s founders helped write the immigration provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (TVPA), affording legal status to hundreds of thousands of survivors and their children since 1994. With over 2,500 members nationwide, ASISTA’s work is focused on 1) providing expert case consultation, training, and resources to attorneys and advocates navigating the complex immigration system on behalf of survivors of gender-based violence, including intervening in specific cases as needed; 2) pushing for federal, state and local policies that ensure safety and justice for immigrant survivors; and 3) coordinating lawsuits to prevent the government from unfairly deporting survivors of violence.

When he was a year old, his father fled El Salvador due to the US-funded Salvadoran Civil War&nbsp;(1980-1992). His mother followed her husband’s footsteps in 1995 when Javier was about to turn five. Zamora was left at the care of his grandparents who helped raise him until he migrated to the US when he was nine.&nbsp;His first poetry collection,&nbsp;<em>Unaccompanied</em>,&nbsp;explores some of these themes.</p>



<p>In his debut&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling memoir,&nbsp;<em>SOLITO</em>, Javier retells his nine-week odyssey across Guatemala, Mexico, and eventually through the Sonoran Desert.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard honored Goodman with the 2014 I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence Lifetime Achievement Award. She is also the first journalist to receive the Right Livelihood Award, widely known as the ‘Alternative Nobel Prize’ for “developing an innovative model of truly independent grassroots political journalism that brings to millions of people the alternative voices that are often excluded by the mainstream media.” She is the first co-recipient of the Park Center for Independent Media’s Izzy Award, named for the great muckraking journalist I.F. Stone, and was later selected for induction into the Park Center’s I.F. Stone Hall of Fame. The Independent of London called Amy Goodman and Democracy Now! “an inspiration.”&nbsp;Goodman has co-authored six&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestsellers. Her latest,&nbsp;<em>Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America</em>, looks back over the past two decades of Democracy Now! and the powerful movements and charismatic leaders who are re-shaping our world.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight national and New York-based legal and community-based organizations working with and addressing the needs of immigrant victims and survivors of crime, domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, forced marriage, and child abuse have signed a letter to the governor urging her to sign the bill into law.</p>



<p>In June the legislature passed the bill, which would ensure that immigrant New Yorkers facing criminal charges get a clear notification that there could be harsh immigration consequences and be alerted to get the advice they are constitutionally entitled to from their attorneys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“As part of the cycle of violence and abuse, survivors often experience arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration,” the groups said in their letter to the governor. “The criminal legal system is … especially stressful for survivors of violence who may be considering the potential of continued violence from their abuser, adding to the pressure to accept a plea to end the process. We are concerned that without a complete understanding of immigration consequences, survivors may unnecessarily accept pleas that are severe and life-changing.” The groups conclude that “it is absolutely vital for immigrant survivors to receive proper notification of potential immigration consequences from the criminal court, and are prompted to seek accurate and clear advice from their counsel to make informed decisions.“</p>

The bill makes critical protections meaningful for all immigrant New Yorkers and creates accountability mechanisms where immigrants’ rights are violated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>QUOTES FROM SIGNATORIES:</strong>
</p>



<p>“In recent years, the Department of Homeland Security has taken an increasingly harsh approach to immigrants with even minor criminal histories,” <strong>notes ASISTA’s Legal &amp; Policy Director, Cristina Velez</strong>. “Many criminalized survivors experience arrest and conviction as an outcome of trauma flowing from abuse, including isolation from resources and information about their options. We at ASISTA are proud to support the Fair Courts for Immigrant New Yorkers bill now on Gov. Hochul’s desk, and hope that it will help immigrant survivors facing convictions to achieve the safety and stability promised by survivor-based remedies.”</p>



<p>“It is unfathomable that defendants are currently agreeing to plead guilty to minor criminal offenses without receiving a proper notification from the court that could lead to their deportation or inability to obtain citizenship,” <strong>said Joan Gerhardt, Director of Public Policy and Advocacy of the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence.</strong> “NYSCADV strongly supports the rights of all individuals participating in New York’s court system to have a thorough understanding of their rights and the consequences of pleading guilty. We thank Assemblymember Cruz and Senator Kavanagh for introducing this critical bill, and urge Governor Hochul to sign it into law as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>“As the nation’s largest non-profit victim assistance organization, we strongly support legislation to ensure Fair Courts for Immigrant New Yorkers,” <strong>said Jimmy Meagher, Policy Director at Safe Horizon</strong>. “Our Immigration Law Project and Anti-Trafficking Program provide legal assistance and support to undocumented and immigrant survivors of violence and abuse. Our staff attorneys and social workers witness up close the consequences and costs for immigrant survivors of receiving misleading or incorrect information about plea deals from the courts. Immigrant defendants, including criminalized survivors, have the right to know the potential risks of pleading guilty to even minor offenses. We applaud the bill’s sponsors – Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and State Senator Brian Kavanagh – for their leadership, and we urge Governor Kathy Hochul to sign this bill into law immediately.”</p>



<p>“As an organization that represents the diverse South Asian diaspora and builds power with community members experiencing abuse and violence in New York, we know well that immigrant survivors face isolation in the criminal legal system,” <strong>said Kavita Mehra, Executive Director of Sakhi for South Asian Women. </strong>“Without access to support they need, our community members are often vulnerable to criminalization. It is for this reason that we need the Governor to sign the Fair Courts for Immigrant New Yorkers bill and ensure that immigrant survivors make informed pleas and have the opportunity to seek the advice they are entitled to.”</p>



<p>“As an organization that seeks to make the law work for all New Yorkers, we know that, annually, thousands of immigrants seeking immigration relief learn the hard way that they are barred from immigration benefits because they made critical criminal justice decisions without proper counsel,” <strong>said Tomás H. Lucero, Senior Victims of Crime Paralegal, Empire Justice Center</strong>. “We support the call for the Governor to stand on the right side of history and sign this bill to buttress constitutional rights for immigrant survivors of crime and all immigrants in our state.”</p>



<p>“To truly protect all survivors of intimate partner violence in New York, it is critical that immigrant survivors in the criminal legal system have accurate notice that a plea could put them at risk of detention and deportation,” <strong>said Madeline Garcia Bigelow, Associate Director of the Urban Justice Center’s Domestic Violence Project.</strong> “We call on the Governor to sign the bill before her for the second time.”</p>



<p>“Trafficking survivors are frequently arrested for offenses related to their trafficking experience. The stress and anxiety of entering the criminal legal system and the system’s lack of knowledge about survivors’ rights result in many receiving criminal records,” <strong>said Emma Ecker, Senior Policy Specialist with Freedom Network USA</strong>. “For this reason, it is imperative that immigrant survivors of trafficking are able to make informed decisions with full knowledge of potential immigration consequences. After passing the state legislature for the second time, we call on Governor Hochul to sign the Fair Courts for Immigrant New Yorkers bill now.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: </strong>July 19, 2023</p>



<p>
<strong>Contact: </strong>Kirsten Rambo, kirsten@asistahelp.org</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Condemns Horrific, Inhumane Treatment of Migrants in Texas</strong>
</p>



<p>As documented by the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/border-trooper-migrants-wire-18205076.php">Houston Chronicle</a> and other outlets such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/18/texas-troopers-inhumane-migrants-greg-abbott-border-initiative">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/us/texas-troopers-migrant-treatment-concerns/index.html">CNN</a>, a trooper-medic with the Texas Department of Public Safety expressed concern to his supervisor earlier this month about the inhumane ways that staff there are being ordered to treat migrants, including pushing people back into the river and refusing drinking water.</p>



<p>The medic also detailed some of the horrifying effects of Texas’s anti-immigrant practices, including the following from just one 7-hour period, as quoted directly here in italics from the CNN report:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<em>A 4-year-old girl passed out in 100-degree heat after Texas (National) Guard personnel pushed the group she was in back toward Mexico</em>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<em>A man with a significant laceration on his leg, suffered when he tried to rescue his child from razor wire placed on a deterrence buoy in the Rio Grande</em>
</li>



<li>
<em>A 15-year-old boy with a broken leg, suffered when he tried to cross a more dangerous part of the river away from the buoys</em>
</li>



<li>
<em>A 19-year-old woman trapped in the wire having a miscarriage</em>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The following day saw the drowning deaths of a mother and two children who were attempting to cross a part of the river that did not contain wire. The medics were also ordered to push a group of people that included nursing babies and young children, who were found in 108-degree weather in the shade, back to the river toward Mexico. Recognizing that these details have emerged from just one report covering only one week, it is difficult to imagine–and almost impossible to know–how many more horrific incidents like these have not been exposed.</p>



<p>The active attempts to harm immigrants employed by Gov. Greg Abbott and his administration shock the conscience and deny the most basic human rights to people seeking refuge. This sadistic targeting of vulnerable people is a disgrace to our nation and must end immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At ASISTA, we hear every day about the multiple forms of trauma experienced by immigrant survivors, often forcing people to flee their homeland,” notes Executive Director, Dr. Kirsten Rambo. “To make the dangerous journey to the US seeking safety and dignity for yourself and your family–only to be met with intentional brutality meant to endanger or end your life and that of your children–is sickening and unconscionable.”</p>



<p>We at ASISTA condemn these acts of state violence in the strongest possible terms, and we urge the Biden administration to use every means at its disposal to end these craven, violent practices. And we urge all people of good conscience to join us in denouncing this monstrous cruelty.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Reflections and Resources</strong>
</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>June 2023</strong>
</h2>



<p>This Pride month and every month, ASISTA celebrates the resilience and bravery of queer and trans immigrants who journey to find safety, love, and self-determination in this country. We also acknowledge that these promises are not always fulfilled, and that LGBTQ+ immigrant survivors face multiple barriers to living free from harm and violence in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 has seen an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/31/650-anti-lgbtq-bills-introduced-us/11552357002/">explosion of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation</a> across the United States. The frightening impact of this moment for LGBTQ+ immigrant survivors is compounded by the surge of anti-immigrant legislation. For example, in the past year, Florida has passed a slate of <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/gov-desantis-signs-slate-of-extreme-anti-lgbtq-bills-enacting-a-record-shattering-number-of-discriminatory-measures-into-law">anti-LGBTQ+ bills</a> banning gender affirming care, expanding the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” ban on discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in public education, prohibiting gender inclusive restrooms, and permitting discrimination in healthcare. Compounding that harm, Florida’s recent, sweeping <a href="https://www.aila.org/advo-media/aila-practice-pointers-and-alerts/fl-1718-florida-anti-immigrant-legislation">anti-immigrant legislation</a> requires, among numerous other provisions designed to create a chilling and inhospitable climate for immigrants, that hospitals collect immigration status information from patients, and law enforcement agencies coordinate with federal immigration enforcement even in the course of initial emergency responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that these measures inevitably fall hardest on undocumented LGBTQ+ immigrant survivors of violence and undermine an already tenuous trust in service providers, thus deepening the isolation of survivors living in dangerous circumstances. We know that when intimate partner violence occurs, and homophobia and threats of deportation are weaponized against them in the criminal legal system, queer and trans immigrant survivors experience <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/police-entanglement-immigration-enforcement-puts-lgbtq-lives-risk/">especially harmful consequences</a>. ASISTA is proud to work with <a href="https://www.api-gbv.org/about-gbv/types-of-gbv/lgbtq-intimate-partner-violence/">partners</a> who <a href="https://esperanzaunited.org/en/tag/lgbtq-2/">address</a> <a href="https://ujimacommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Fact-Sheet-LGBTQ-Thumbnail.png">these</a> concerns with compassion and respect, and celebrates our members who provide respectful and affirming services directly to LGBTQIA+ immigrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As challenging as this moment is, we also recognize the healing power of community. During the recent week of remembrance, the Orlando Museum of Art unveiled <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/pulse-nightclub-shooting-mural-180982384/">a mural in honor</a> of the victims and survivors of the Pulse massacre that killed 49 mostly queer and trans Latinx people in 2016. Having just held our pre-AILA conference in Orlando this week (recordings to follow), and connected with some of the amazing advocates for immigrant survivors in Florida, ASISTA is proud to work alongside all of you for a better world everywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because these issues are central to effective advocacy, we are sharing these toolkits for addressing hate and intimate partner violence in LGBTQIA+ communities from the <a href="https://avp.org/ncavp/ncavp-toolkits/">National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs</a>, which is coordinated by a longtime ASISTA member, the <a href="https://avp.org/">NYC Anti-Violence Project</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: </strong>May 25, 2023</p>

<strong>Contact: </strong>Kirsten Rambo, <a href="mailto:kirsten@asistahelp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kirsten@asistahelp.org</a>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Celebrates the Launch of US’s First-Ever National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence (GBV)</strong>
</p>



<p>ASISTA is pleased to be at the White House complex today to witness the historic launch of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/National-Plan-to-End-GBV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-ever National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence.</a> We were happy to provide input into the development of the plan by hosting a listening session with Rosie Hidalgo, Special Assistant to the President for Gender Policy and Senior Advisor for the White House Gender Policy Council, on October 4th, 2021. At that session, we gathered a variety of stakeholders who shared the myriad challenges facing immigrant survivors, from xenophobia, transphobia and racism, to barriers to asylum and employment, and much more.</p>



<p>We are glad to see the inclusion of immigrant survivors throughout the National Action Plan. Furthermore, the Plan includes a specific call, long raised by immigrant survivors and the advocates who serve them, for a solution to the egregiously long wait times for immigration relief such as U visas–wait times that only further endanger survivors and their children. Much work remains to be done, both within and outside of this administration and the federal government, to advance safety for immigrant survivors. The Plan provides a critical framework and lays an important foundation for a path forward.</p>



<p>ASISTA Executive Director, Dr. Kirsten Rambo, attending the event, notes, “The development of this National Action Plan represents a truly historic achievement. Addressing the particular needs of immigrant survivors is absolutely crucial today, especially given the mounting barriers faced by survivors in this increasingly hostile political climate. An incredibly important and logical next step is for the Biden-Harris administration and the U.S. Congress to bring our country’s immigration policies into alignment with the goals of this Plan, to ensure that immigrant survivors are no longer harmed by US policies and practices as they seek safety and justice. We look forward to working with all our partners to realize the vision of this plan, which resonates with ASISTA’s own vision:&nbsp; that immigrants live in a just world free from violence.”</p>



<p>Established in 2008, ASISTA is a national leader in the movement for safety and justice for immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. ASISTA’s founders helped write the immigration provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (TVPA), affording legal status to hundreds of thousands of survivors and their children since 1994. With over 2,500 members nationwide, ASISTA’s work is focused on 1) providing expert case consultation, training, and resources to attorneys and advocates navigating the complex immigration system on behalf of survivors of gender-based violence, including intervening in specific cases as needed; 2) pushing for federal, state and local policies that ensure safety and justice for immigrant survivors; and 3) coordinating lawsuits to prevent the government from unfairly deporting survivors of violence.

<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: </strong>March 31, 2023</p>



<p>
<strong>Contacts:</strong>
<strong>
<br>
</strong>Kirsten Rambo, kirsten@asistahelp.org<br>Cristina Velez, cristina@asistahelp.org&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Statement on USCIS’s Opening of </strong>
<strong>Humanitarian, Adjustment, Removing Conditions, and Travel Documents (HART) Service Center</strong>
</p>



<p>In a major announcement, <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/03/30/immigration-agency-sets-up-new-virtual-service-center/">USCIS has revealed the opening of the Humanitarian, Adjustment, Removing Conditions, and Travel Documents (HART) Service Center</a>, a brand-new addition to its Service Center Operations. HART is currently focused on humanitarian relief, specifically VAWA self-petitions (I-360),&nbsp; bona fide determinations (BFDs) for U visa petitions (I-918), and reunification of refugees and asylees with their family members (I-730).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to USCIS, the HART Service Center will be staffed with specially-trained adjudicators for these petitions, including 150 from other service centers and an additional 330 to be hired. The Center, currently working in a hybrid setting, is planned to eventually be a fully remote operation.</p>



<p>The opening of this new Service Center has the potential to make real, positive change for immigrant survivors of violence. Kirsten Rambo, Executive Director of ASISTA, noted, “We welcome this news about the establishment of the new HART Service Center. The current cap on the number of U visas granted each year, and the limited resources at USCIS to process applications, has led to a truly untenable situation in which survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other crimes wait many, many years for the relief they deserve. These egregious wait times only compound existing trauma for survivors and their children and extend their separation from family members abroad. We are hopeful that the new HART Service Center will help alleviate that trauma by focusing much-needed resources on providing relief to survivors more quickly and efficiently. It is our hope that this newly coordinated focus on these humanitarian cases will afford survivors much quicker access to safety, justice, and stability–all of which benefits not only survivors and their families, but also their communities and our society as a whole.”</p>



<p>The immigration provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) were designed to ensure that survivors of gender-based violence could access safety, stability, independence from abusers, and more. Over time, as backlogs and waitlists have continued to grow, survivor-based forms of immigration relief have become increasingly challenging to access, leaving survivors in precarious and often dangerous positions while they wait. The opening of the HART Service Center brings hope that the life-changing, and often life-saving protections afforded by VAWA can once again become more meaningfully accessible to survivors and their children.</p>



<p>Training on trauma-informed approaches will be critical for the HART Service Center’s success.&nbsp; Those with experience representing or supporting immigrant survivors of gender-based violence who are interested in being part of the new Service Center should note that the HART Service Center is currently hiring and will be seeking to fill 330 newly authorized positions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>ASISTA Calls on&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Biden Administration to Reject Reinstating Detention of Migrant Families</strong>
</p>



<p>The New York Times has reported that&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=339107&amp;targetUrl=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/us/politics/biden-immigration-family-detention.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden administration is now considering reinstating the detaining of migrant families</a>,&nbsp;a callous, destructive policy that has been widely condemned–including, previously, by the President himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to this news, ASISTA Executive Director Dr. Kirsten Rambo states, “Family detention is a cruel practice that causes lasting harm to children and their parents. For the many immigrants who come to this country seeking safety from violence, family detention only exacerbates their suffering, heaping new layers of trauma onto existing trauma. The burdens of this racist, xenophobic policy are borne disproportionately by Black and brown immigrants, further traumatizing individuals, families, and communities already suffering under the daily weight of systemic racism. Furthermore, family detention does absolutely nothing to alleviate the ongoing tragedy of sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence that occur daily at the border. Immigrant survivors of violence, like all immigrants, deserve to be met with compassion and dignity, not dehumanization.”</p>



<p>Like countless others–including&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=339104&amp;targetUrl=https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/139/5/e20170483/38727/Detention-of-Immigrant-Children?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pediatricians</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=339115&amp;targetUrl=https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/acp-says-family-detention-harms-the-health-of-children-other-family-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=339113&amp;targetUrl=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/doctors-letter-immigration-detention/3cb2a9e68492ea5d/full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health experts</a>–President Biden himself has recognized the inhumanity of family detention, previously stating,&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=339110&amp;targetUrl=https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1277024411091075072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can’t believe I have to say it: Families belong together.”</a>
</p>



<p>To learn that this administration is nonetheless considering a return to this cruel policy is both&nbsp;heartbreaking and infuriating. Immigrant survivors of violence, and all immigrants, deserve far better. We at ASISTA denounce this practice and urge the Biden administration to reject it wholeheartedly–and to instead adopt approaches that recognize the inherent human dignity of immigrant survivors of violence, their children, and all immigrants.</p>

<strong>&nbsp;Anti-Blackness and Immigrant Survivors of Gender-Based Violence&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>in Collaboration with Ujima, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>The racism that pervades the US immigration system creates particular hardships for Black survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). ASISTA and Ujima, Inc. (the National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community) have released a<a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ASISTA-Ujima-Anti-Blackness-Practice-Advisory-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> brand-new practice advisory addressing the impact of anti-Blackness on immigrant survivors of GBV. </a>This resource explores how the specific intersection of sexism, anti-Blackness, xenophobia, and criminalization presents unique obstacles to relief for Black immigrant survivors. Importantly, the advisory also contains practical information on how practitioners and advocates can provide anti-racist and culturally responsive services to Black immigrant survivors of GBV. </p>



<p>As ASISTA Staff Attorney Kelly Head comments, “ASISTA is honored to collaborate with our partners at Ujima, Inc. on this important resource for immigration practitioners and advocates. The very real effects of these intersecting oppressions–while ever-present in the lives of Black immigrant survivors–are rarely addressed. With this resource, ASISTA and Ujima, Inc. hope to start filling this critical gap and to stimulate conversations in both the immigration and gender-based violence fields about these important issues.”</p>



<p>Ayana Wallace Vieux, Ujima’s Training and Technical Assistance Manager, observes, “As change-makers, we must address the complex realities of Black immigrant survivors and the multi-layered systemic and structural forms of violence they face when trying to get help. Xenophobia and deeply rooted anti-Blackness render Black immigrant survivors invisible in a system in which they are overrepresented. Ujima Inc. is proud to be a part of a collective movement with ASISTA to give voice to Black immigrant survivors and improve access to safety and justice, however the survivor defines them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASISTA’s Executive Director Kirsten Rambo concludes, “The exciting collaboration between ASISTA and Ujima has resulted in an advisory that represents a critical contribution to several fields. This resource is only able to exist because of the solid foundation built by Black feminist scholars and activists over many decades. Our sincere, shared hope is that this document will be put to use widely and quickly to advance justice for Black immigrant survivors of gender-based violence.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ujima Inc., The National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community was founded in 2015 in response to the need for an active approach to ending violence against women in the Black community – domestic, sexual, and community violence. The name “Ujima” is from the third principle of Kwanzaa, which means Collective Work and Responsibility. This principle is critical to addressing violence against Black women in the United States. Ujima, through education and outreach, training and technical assistance, resource development, research, and public policy efforts, mobilizes the Black community and allies to strengthen our families, recognizing the safety and viability of our families is connected to the health and well-being of our individual neighborhoods and communities at large. We define the Black community as the African Diaspora in its broadest sense, e.g., Black Americans (descendants of the enslaved in the U.S.) and African, Afro-Caribbean, and Afro-Latinx immigrants, refugees, and asylees. Ujima, Inc. provides a resource hub for survivors of violence and their family and friends; enhances the capacity of coalitions, local, state, and federal government agencies, community based programs, researchers, and policymakers; advocates for social change; engages in meaningful and impactful research that addresses the intersections of race, class, and gender to improve services and responses to Black survivors; and (5) develops evidence-based tools to reduce domestic violence homicides in our community.</p>

<strong>ASISTA Releases Practice Advisory on Representing Criminalized Immigrant Survivors</strong>
</p>



<p>ASISTA has released a <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Representing-Criminalized-Survivors-Practice-Advisory-January-2023-.docx.pdf">practice advisory for immigration practitioners that provides an introduction to the impacts of criminal-legal system contacts on eligibility for survivor-based immigration relief.</a> Immigrant survivors may be criminalized for many reasons, including abusers using the criminal-legal system against survivors or forcing survivors to commit crimes, commission of crimes that are necessary for survival, and racially discriminatory over-policing. It is crucial that attorneys and advocates understand how criminalization may affect a survivor’s access to immigration relief and how to help survivors access life-saving relief despite a criminal record. This advisory surveys common criminal grounds of inadmissibility, bars to good moral character, exceptions, waivers, and the impact of criminal grounds of inadmissibility on eligibility for survivor-based remedies such as U-visas, T-visas, Adjustment of Status, VAWA Self-Petitions, and VAWA cancellation of removal. This practice advisory also contains practice tips for immigration practitioners who represent criminalized survivors and links to additional resources.</p>



<p>“In recent years, USCIS has taken an increasingly harsh approach to immigrant survivors with even minor criminal histories,” notes ASISTA’s Legal &amp; Policy Director, Cristina Velez. “Many criminalized survivors experience arrest and conviction as an outcome of trauma flowing from abuse, including social isolation and lack of resources. Despite the broad waivers authorized by Congress to address this reality, USCIS routinely subjects survivors to unwarranted scrutiny of their arrests and mischaracterizes the impact of their convictions. We at ASISTA are glad to provide this resource to help advocates nationwide as they work with criminalized immigrant survivors to achieve the safety and stability promised by survivor-based remedies.”</p>

<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:&nbsp;January 12, 2023</strong>
</p>

<strong>Contacts:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Kirsten Rambo,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kirsten@asistahelp.org">kirsten@asistahelp.org</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cristina Velez,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cristina@asistahelp.org">cristina@asistahelp.org</a>
</p>



<p>ASISTA has released a<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13jgtAtXwMUqLO6QSMkSnrN35k0-6_6rs/view?usp=share_link"> </a>
<a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ASISTA-Practice-Alert_-Abortion-Rights-for-Immigrant-Survivors-Impact-of-Dobbs-Jan-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practice alert for immigration and gender-based violence advocates and attorneys, regarding the impact of abortion restrictions on immigration status after the overturning of <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade</em>.</a> Given the increase in abortion restrictions and threats of criminalization that have followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Dobbs </em>v.<em> Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, practitioners across the U.S. are concerned about the best way to serve immigrant clients as they seek reproductive healthcare, including abortion.</p>



<p>A highly practical resource, the alert explains how, against a backdrop of emboldened reproductive abuse and coercion, survivors must now also navigate increasingly severe abortion restrictions and their potential effects in the immigration and criminal legal systems. This practice alert provides guidance and resources to legal advocates working with survivors of violence (such as domestic abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking) at the intersection of immigration and abortion rights. The document also reflects the invaluable input of ASISTA’s partners at If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At a time when basic reproductive healthcare has become politicized and weaponized, issues of restricted access to abortion–and the efforts to criminalize those who provide it–are of grave concern,” notes ASISTA’s Executive Director, Kirsten Rambo. “The effects of decreased access and potential criminalization can be devastating, <em>particularly </em>for immigrant survivors of violence on their path to citizenship. We at ASISTA are glad to provide this resource to help attorneys and advocates nationwide as they serve immigrants who, already traumatized by violence, are also faced with a complex, fraught, and often hostile landscape as they seek reproductive care.”</p>



<p>This practice alert follow’s <a href="https://medium.com/@legalassistant_98416/abortion-restrictions-are-gender-based-violence-centering-immigrant-survivors-is-crucial-for-682bff1ce294">ASISTA’s earlier comments on the <em>Dobbs </em>decision</a>. To read the practice alert, <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ASISTA-Practice-Alert_-Abortion-Rights-for-Immigrant-Survivors-Impact-of-Dobbs-Jan-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Established in 2008, ASISTA is a national leader in the movement for safety and justice for immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. ASISTA’s founders helped write the immigration provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (TVPA), affording legal status to hundreds of thousands of survivors and their children since 1994. With over 600 members nationwide, ASISTA’s work is focused on 1) providing expert case consultation, training, and resources to attorneys and advocates navigating the complex immigration system on behalf of survivors of gender-based violence, including intervening in specific cases as needed; 2) pushing for federal, state and local policies that ensure safety and justice for immigrant survivors; and 3) coordinating lawsuits to prevent the government from unfairly deporting survivors of violence.

<![CDATA[<p>ASISTA and the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors led a sign on letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to vacate and overrule three precedents that prevent immigration adjudicators from respecting post-conviction or sentencing relief granted to immigrant survivors under state and federal law.  The letter, which was joined by 68 organizations and 13 individuals, discussed the ways in which abusers manipulate the criminal legal system, and the injustices of the criminal legal system itself that harm survivors who are Black, Latinx, Asian and Pacific Islander, from the Middle East, Indigenous, and people of color as well as LGBTQ survivors of these groups.

<![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022. This important bill reflects a bipartisan consensus that the government needs to do more to prevent and respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The bill addresses many of the needs identified during extensive engagement with the domestic violence and sexual assault fields. A summary of the Senate bill can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKV4t3HqoJkdPK_8RIn5xvSXhEhgt9-rl4iZDp55lxw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>



<p>The House of Representatives passed their version of this bill, led by Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX-18) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-01), last March. ASISTA encourages the Senate to swiftly pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 and send it to the House for a vote.</p>



<p>We know that a stronger, more inclusive bill would have contained additional protections for immigrant survivors, given the many additional barriers to achieving safety and justice that immigrants experience.&nbsp; At the same time, we are pleased that the bill includes increased support for culturally specific services and other critical protections that will benefit countless survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAKE ACTION!</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Organizations and individuals: </strong>Join the NTF in urging your senators to cosponsor and vote in favor of this bill.

<td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">ASISTA is proud to report that our litigation against ICE has come to a successful resolution. The case was brought by Protect Democracy and the Constitutional Accountability Center on behalf of ASISTA and Sanctuary for Families. The litigation challenged the unlawful policy, established by then-acting director of ICE Matthew Albence, that made it easier to deport immigrant survivors of violence who 1) came forward to report crimes committed against them and 2) helped law enforcement in prosecuting those crimes. Albence, who was serving in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, had no authority to establish that harmful policy, which directly and indirectly resulted in an untold number of unfair deportations. <br>
<br>Last month, ICE issued a<a class="" href="https://asista.app.neoncrm.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;{{emailTrackingId}}&amp;{{secureId}}&amp;linkId=41369&amp;targetUrl=https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/fKv6uM-ykMIhjGH39TthKQ7Qb3mKGCdTaUYw3hkS_9s=/aYKj8-KmY7jeiZdJEBy-qBWkmZhffLWaLkxN-nULL1c=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> new directive</a> replacing the illegal Albence policy we were challenging.  Because this new directive restores the protections that were eliminated, the litigation was dismissed.<br>
<br>This is a win for immigrant survivors of violence. ASISTA is grateful to our partners and proud to persevere in the cause of justice and fairness for immigrant survivors.</td>

<![CDATA[<p>June 14, 2021</p>



<p>ASISTA applauds <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-updates/20210614-VictimsOfCrimes.pdf">USCIS’s policy alert</a> announcing work authorization for U visa petitioners who present a bona fide case. This policy will help alleviate the myriad barriers that victims and their families face as a result of the significant processing delays in the U visa program.&nbsp; Currently <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/I918u_visastatistics_fy2021_qtr1.pdf">there are nearly 270,000 individuals</a> with pending U visa matters, and the processing times just to place these cases on the waitlist is nearly 5 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>These long waits for the adjudication of their cases can be devastating to U visa petitioners who face dire personal and economic hardship, often placing them at risk of deportation or other abusive and exploitative situations as they struggle to survive. This new USCIS policy will provide many U visa petitioners a path to timely work authorization and deferred action status, which will help alleviate these risks. We appreciate USCIS’s efforts to take action to alleviate the barriers these delays have caused and to increase the effectiveness of the remedies Congress created for immigrant survivors of violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>ASISTA’s Executive Director Kirsten Rambo states, “We are extremely encouraged by this news from USCIS today. This policy is a very promising step forward to ensure that immigrant survivors of violence can now have a much clearer path to safety and stability, as Congress originally intended. We are also deeply grateful to our partners in advocacy who have worked alongside us on this issue by conducting research, engaging in administrative and legislative advocacy, and pursuing federal litigation.”</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>ASISTA looks forward to working with USCIS and our partners to identify and understand fully the practical implications of this policy for all survivors, from the impact on the U visa waitlist to understanding how discretionary determinations will be made&nbsp;related to arrests. As always, we remain committed to ensuring that safety and justice for all immigrant survivors is centered in these discussions and to updating the field with the latest developments.&nbsp; <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Policy-Alert_-Bona-Fide-Employment-Authorization-for-U-petitioners-1.pdf">Read ASISTA’s policy alert here</a>. We will continue to share additional resources about this and other policy matters that impact immigrant survivors of violence.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.immigrantsurvivors.org/s/105-Organizations-Support-Strengthening-Immigration-Protections-in-VAWA-2021.pdf">
<strong>Alliance for Immigrant Survivors (AIS) sent a letter signed by 105 organizations to Senate leadership</strong> </a>to strengthen protections for immigrant survivors in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) 2021. For over 25 years, VAWA has served as a rare example of how a bipartisan Congress can protect survivors and strengthen their ability to overcome abuse. Now, as the Senate considers its next actions on VAWA, we urge them to continue the tradition of safeguarding protections for all survivors, including immigrant survivors who are experiencing domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<a href="https://www.immigrantsurvivors.org/ais-applauds-house-vawa-passage-urges-immigrant-provisions-in-senate-version">AIS supports the latest bipartisan VAWA reauthorization</a>,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1620"> H.R. 1620</a>, which takes a holistic approach, addressing the complexities of survivors’ lives, and maintains established protections, while also addressing persistent gaps. Yet, VAWA 2021 doesn’t solve the problems facing tens of thousands of immigrant survivors who have faced additional threats and barriers over the last several years.</p>



<p>
<a href="https://www.immigrantsurvivors.org/s/105-Organizations-Support-Strengthening-Immigration-Protections-in-VAWA-2021.pdf">In our letter</a>, we called on the Senate to include these critical protections for immigrant survivors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ensure that survivors are not deported before their applications are adjudicated as this clearly undermines the bipartisan purpose that survivors have the ability to seek protection against deportation;</li>
<li>Raise the U Visa cap so that more survivors have access to these critical protections, an effort that was supported by President Biden given its inclusion in<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/"> the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021</a>;</li>
<li>Add hate crimes and other qualifying crimes to the U visa statute to ensure that those who are victims of racist violence may seek paths to safety and justice;</li>
<li>Strengthen confidentiality in protections for survivors who apply for VAWA self petitions, U visa and T visa applications by limiting information sharing about their applications;</li>
<li>Ensure access to work authorization for survivors given the egregious delays in the processing of VAWA self-petitions, U visa and T visa applications. These significant delays, coupled with other barriers, such as a lack of access to financial supports, can subject survivors to additional risks and barriers;</li>
<li>Provide access to basic economic and housing supports for immigrant survivors in order to escape and overcome abuse and exploitation.</li>
</ul>



<p>This latest reauthorization of VAWA is already three years behind schedule, as the last reauthorization was in 2013. Failure to strengthen immigration protections created in VAWA and subsequent reauthorizations has resulted in substantial barriers for immigrant survivors and their children. <strong>
<em>The time to strengthen these immigration protections is now, and VAWA is the right vehicle to do it.</em>

<![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the killing of eight people in Georgia earlier this week, we at ASISTA are heartbroken and determined as ever to fight the toxic combination of white supremacy and misogyny that fuels this violence. Eight lives were tragically and violently taken, of whom seven were women and six were of Asian descent. We send our love and light to those most directly impacted, the families and friends of the victims. And we stand in solidarity with Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities, understanding that this horrific act is a recent manifestation of a long history of racism and exclusion in the U.S. to which AAPI individuals and communities have been subjected for generations.</p>



<p>Our mission and our work at ASISTA stand at this specific intersection of battling misogyny, racism, and violence. We recognize that the forces underlying these recent murders in Georgia are at the root of the many injustices we see throughout our work: from decisions about who is welcomed and who gets deported, to who experiences state violence in addition to intimate violence, to whose labor is exploited and devalued, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the insidiousness of white supremacy is that the echoes of its violence reverberate throughout all groups who are targeted and treated unjustly. At ASISTA, we stand committed to continuing the fight against systemic racism and toxic masculinity in all their forms, as well as the violence that they engender.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To our friends in the AAPI community, in Georgia and everywhere, our hearts are with you. We stand with you, in unity, respect, and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To everyone reading this, thank you for being a part of our ASISTA community, for standing up against these malignant forces with us, and for all you do to make the world safer for immigrant survivors of violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In solidarity,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On March 10, 2021, Senior District Judge Susan Illston from the U.S. District Court of Northern District of California <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Centro-Legal-De-la-Raza-v.-EOIR-PI-Order.pdf">granted a preliminary injunction </a>in the case <em>Centro Legal de La Raza et al v. EOIR et al</em>, challenging<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/16/2020-27008/appellate-procedures-and-decisional-finality-in-immigration-proceedings-administrative-closure"> the harmful DOJ rule</a> severely limiting <em>sua sponte </em>motions in immigration court proceedings and curtailing the use of administrative closure as docket management tool, among other harmful provisions.</p>



<p>ASISTA and our partners <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-01-29-27-1-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae.pdf">submitted an amicus brief</a> in support of the Plaintiffs, Centro Legal de La Raza, Tahirih Justice Center, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, and RAICES, who were represented by Sidley Austin, LLP, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Asian Law Caucus, and Lakin &amp; Wille LLP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our amicus demonstrated the impact that eliminating administrative closure would have on survivors. The Court found that the plaintiffs “are likely to succeed on their claim that the agencies did not engage in reasoned decision-making when formulating the Rule . . . including that the changes implemented by the Rule will foreclose noncitizens from seeking humanitarian relief to which they may be entitled and will result in the deportation of noncitizens who have meritorious claims for relief.”</p>



<p>The order directly cites our amicus brief, including the significant U visa wait times, and references how the briefs submitted “<strong>
<em>provide numerous specific real-life examples of how administrative closure has been used in cases to allow survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, including children, to pursue claims for relief before USCIS and state court.</em>
</strong>”</p>



<p>Judge Illston’s order enjoins EOIR from implementing or enforcing the rule pending final adjudication of the case, to take effect immediately. The impact of this order signifies that immigration judges and BIA members continue to have the authority to reopen proceedings&nbsp; <em>sua sponte</em>, and that the broad pre-January 15, 2021 regulatory language at 8 C.F.R. 1003.10(b) (held to permit administrative closure in <em>Zuniga-Romero v. Barr</em> and <em>Meza-Morales v. Barr</em>) remains in effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are grateful for the incredible work of our pro bono team at Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, LLP on our amicus brief. In addition, we’re grateful to the plaintiffs and representatives in this litigation as well as the efforts of those involved in challenging this harmful rule in the D.C. District Court, including National Immigrant Justice Center, CLINIC, HAIS, Brooklyn Defender Service, FIRRP, and Democracy Forward.</p>

<strong>Interim ICE Guidance:&nbsp;</strong>
</a>Last week&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8282&amp;targetUrl=https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2021/021821_civil-immigration-enforcement_interim-guidance.pdf">ICE released new interim guidance</a>&nbsp;on enforcement priorities which will be in place at least for the next 90 days. This new guidance broadens enforcement provisions contained in the January 20, 2021 memo.The guidance changes the public safety enforcement priority to encompass 1) &nbsp;those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in the INA); 2) those “convicted of offense involving participation in a criminal street gang, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 521(a), and 3) those not younger than 16 years of age and who intentionally participated in an organized criminal gang or transnational criminal organization to further the illegal activity of the gang or transnational criminal organization.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>The guidance indicates that enforcement action may be taken&nbsp;outside&nbsp;these priorities but are subject to advance review, and spells out factors that may be considered in taking enforcement action outside the listed priority grounds. The guidance also instructs that attention should be exercised to individuals who are elderly, suffering from illness, or those with pending petitions for review on direct appeal from an order of removal; have filed only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and such a motion either remains pending or is on direct appeal via a petition for review; or have pending applications for immigration relief and are prima facie eligible for such relief. In such cases, execution of removal orders should have&nbsp;a compelling reason&nbsp;and are to have approval from the Field Office Director. We encourage you to find more information about this guidance from our partners at<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8277&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nipnlg.org/PDFs/practitioners/practice_advisories/gen/2021_19Feb_ice-community-explainer.pdf?fbclid%3DIwAR3OAHvnV5CxcF-SSArGCyXh-QNMc3jRYRosx6SQl9_iqVcxIv-TI5iwwx0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325428000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3QQlGsJusdgPCHEmfel2Uc">NIPNLG</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8269&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://immigrantjustice.org/press-releases/ices-new-enforcement-memo-offers-incremental-change-perpetuates-enforcement?eId%3De1903a08-27a6-4fa4-8754-51f5a341ff07%26eType%3DEmailBlastContent&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325428000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26rm3EI4NZhk5XkX5jNuXa">NIJC here.</a>

<strong>ASISTA Comment I-918 Forms:</strong>
</a>&nbsp;On January 14, 2021, USCIS published a&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8279&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.regulations.gov/document/USCIS-2010-0004-0064&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325429000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2UTPkdPL5NAZBq6NB2p_KY">notice for comment on the U visa forms</a>&nbsp;(I-918, Supplement A, Supplement B, and their associated instructions). While the agency did not propose any changes to the forms or their instructions,&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8284&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USCIS-2010-0004-0072&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325429000&amp;usg=AOvVaw276mFBVqpyloxkevPfulKy">ASISTA submitted a comment&nbsp;</a>recommending amendments to the forms and instructions to rectify and clarify issues that have arisen over time, including: the elimination of the signature requirement on the Supplement A for derivatives; the allowance of electronically reproduced signatures on all forms; and the elimination of language in the form instructions that USCIS could use to justify the blank spaces policy.<br>

<a>USCIS Policy Manual Comment on Employment Authorization:</a>&nbsp;</strong>On February 15, 2021 ASISTA&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8270&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Policy-Manual-Comment-Feb-15-2021-FINAL-1.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UmSoVmqVGbn7qy570PMh_">submitted a comment in response&nbsp;</a>to Policy Manual changes regarding the exercise of discretion in granting employment authorization based on deferred action or having a pending adjustment application. &nbsp;Even though the Policy Manual provisions had carve-outs for survivor based relief, we remain opposed to provisions that needlessly create barriers for employment authorization.</li>

<strong>4. Litigation Updates</strong>
</a>
</p>



<p>
<strong>a.&nbsp;<a>Gonzalez v. Cuccinelli:</a>&nbsp;</strong>On January 14, 2021, the 4th Circuit published its opinion in&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8266&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191435.P.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_fF8-oCDfJ_1mEPNmgzKh">Gonzalez v. Cuccinelli</a>, a case in which several U visa applicants had sued USCIS over the years-long delay in the adjudication of their applications. The results were mixed: The Court found that it lacked jurisdiction to review USCIS’s failure to issue pre-waiting list employment authorization under INA 214(p)(6) and that the repeal of 8 CFR § 274a(13)(d) was retroactive; however, it did overturn the district judge’s dismissal of the claim regarding USCIS’s failure to make a waiting list determination for the plaintiffs. ASISTA and the Tahirih Justice Center submitted an amicus brief on this case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>b.&nbsp;<a>Administrative Closure Rule Amicus brief:&nbsp;</a>
</strong>On February 5, 2021 ASISTA, API-GBV and partner organizations filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs in the case&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=efa2e67c3f6e903b6c3473e5b1b9a702em5378321efa&amp;secureId=l4vkLVqraB3RnbXECJd2BA%3D%3D&amp;linkId=8268&amp;targetUrl=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://democracyforward.org/lawsuits/clinic-et-al-v-eoir-et-al/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614446325431000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kUp18yFO05fpdJOUPEDVX">CLINIC et al v.

</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<a>
<strong>Flexibility in Deadline Extension</strong>
</a>&nbsp;Last week, USCIS announced that it will extend its flexibility policy.&nbsp; This policy will now apply to documents in which&nbsp;the issuance date listed on the request, notice or decision is between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. &nbsp;For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7896&amp;targetUrl=https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-response-to-covid-19">USCIS Response to COVID-19 here</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>

<strong>
<a>Challenges to Enforcement Executive Order</a>
</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7895&amp;targetUrl=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/federal-court-in-texas-blocks-bidens-100-day-deportation-pause/2021/01/26/7c311b10-6011-11eb-ac8f-4ae05557196e_story.html">As you may have heard</a>, a judge in Texas&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7898&amp;targetUrl=https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1811836/gov.uscourts.txsd.1811836.16.0_1.pdf">has enjoined</a>&nbsp;portions of Biden’s Executive Order on Enforcement and the related DHS guidance regarding the 100-day moratorium on deportations. Our partners at NIPNLG and La Resistencia have developed&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7901&amp;targetUrl=https://nipnlg.org/PDFs/practitioners/practice_advisories/gen/2021_27Jan-100-day-facts.pdf">a fact sheet&nbsp;</a>explaining what has been enjoined and what remains in effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Based upon our reading of this decision, we believe that the rescission of the 2018 Notice to Appear Memo from 2018 in effect.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a>
<strong>New Circuit Court Decisions</strong>
</a>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>New First Circuit Decision:</strong>&nbsp;This new decision&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7903&amp;targetUrl=http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/20-1541P-01A.pdf">Granados Benitez v. Wilkinson</a>&nbsp;ruled that the BIA abused its discretion in refusing to reopen proceedings for a U visa petitioner who had been placed on the waitlist. Of note, the court found that&nbsp;<em>Matter of Sanchez Sosa&nbsp;</em>remains good law and that the&nbsp;<em>Sanchez Sosa</em>&nbsp;factors apply to motions to reopen where the purpose of the motion is to seek a continuance. &nbsp;ASISTA and other amici were represented by&nbsp;Greenberg Traurig in support of the Petitioner in this case. Huge thanks to Petitioner’s counsel, Paige Austin and Phil Torrey!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Ninth Circuit Decision:</strong>&nbsp;In the published decision,&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7897&amp;targetUrl=https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/01/29/18-73001.pdf">Kaur v. Wilkinson</a>, the panel found that, “The BIA erred in imposing evidentiary requirements of ongoing injury or treatment beyond the sexual assault itself in order to show persecution. Kaur’s credible testimony about the attempted gang rape is sufficient to show persecution.&nbsp;Attempted rape by a gang of men, in broad daylight on a public street, is especially terrorizing because it powerfully demonstrates the perpetrator’s domination, control over the victim and imperviousness to the law. Requiring evidence of additional harms both minimizes the gravity of the sexual assault and demeans the victim.&nbsp;We grant Kaur’s petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.” (emphasis added)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a>
<strong>ASISTA joins important amicus efforts</strong>
</a>&nbsp;<ul>
<li>Last week, ASISTA and our partners submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs in the new litigation&nbsp;<em>Centro Legal de La Raza, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services v. EOIR.</em>&nbsp; This case challenges EOIR’s new rule regarding administrative closure, and our amicus highlightis the harm that this rule places on survivor-based immigration cases. Read the brief&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7899&amp;targetUrl=https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-01-29-27-1-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae.pdf">here</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>ASISTA was proud to join over 100 organizations nationwide as&nbsp;amicus on behalf of the respondents&nbsp;in the pending Supreme Court case of&nbsp;Pekoske v. Innovation Law Lab, et al.&nbsp;(previously,&nbsp;Wolf v. Innovation Law Lab, et al.) The government appealed the&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;%3C%3CemailTrackingId%3E%3E&amp;%3C%3CsecureId%3E%3E&amp;linkId=7893&amp;targetUrl=https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/02/28/19-15716.pdf">9th circuit’s decision</a>&nbsp;upholding an injunction against the continued implementation and expansion of Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).

Wolf</em>.&nbsp;This means that the increased fees and changes to fee waiver policies and procedures under the August 2020 rule will not be implemented by USCIS at this time.&nbsp; In addition, changes to the I-912 form initially proposed in September 2018 continue to be enjoined pursuant to cases&nbsp;<em>

<strong>Receipt Notice Delays at USCIS Lockbox Facilities.</strong>

<em>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, USCIS is experiencing delays in issuing receipt notices for some applications and petitions filed at a USCIS lockbox facility. The information below explains the current state of our lockbox operations and the issues affecting receipt notices.”&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;USCIS recommends filing online where possible, creating a USCIS online account, and submitting Form G-1145 E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance. Because of these delays and the potential for receipt notice irregularities, we remind ASISTA members of these filing tips:<ul>
<li>Submit all filings to USCIS using a trackable delivery method.</li>
<li>Track and maintain evidence of delivery confirmation for each case filing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Check the filing date (and priority date, if applicable) on each I-797 receipt notice immediately upon receipt for any potential discrepancies.</li>

<a>Automatic Extension of LPR cards:</a>

<strong>USCIS has recently changed procedures</strong>
</a>
<strong>&nbsp;to automatically extend LPR cards –&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;LPR cards will now be extended automatically for 12 months when an I-90 is filed. The extension will be noted on the I-797 receipt notices. This change came about as part of Ruiz v. DHS (CD Calif), a pending class action regarding the unavailability of I-551 stamps. The I-797 notices will be similar to those issued to extend conditional permanent resident status upon filing of form I-751. Huge thanks to ASISTA members representing the plaintiffs: Javier Maldonado, Stacy Tolchin, Megan Brewer, and Sabrina Damast!<br>&nbsp;</li>

<p>1.&nbsp;<a>Expansion of Filing Flexibility</a>:&nbsp;On December 18, USCIS announced that it would continue its policy of flexible deadlines for requests, notices or decisions issued between March 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021, inclusive.&nbsp; For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=e385602d97c47c132ce27e0f65e47c1eem121599e38&amp;secureId=okMG8WJBqsDh3HENgRtQIg%3D%3D&amp;linkId=7096&amp;targetUrl=https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-response-to-covid-19">https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-response-to-covid-19</a>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>2.&nbsp;<a>Important Update on Blank Space Policy Litigation:</a>&nbsp;</strong>Good news in&nbsp;<em>Vangala v. USCIS</em>, the lawsuit that the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and Van Der Hout LLP filed last month, challenging USCIS’ blank space/rejection policy.&nbsp;USCIS has agreed to pause implementation of the rejection policy starting December 24, 2020; the parties will enter into negotiations to resolve the claims. NILA, NWIRP, and VDH will be reaching out as they begin discussing proposals as to how to identify applications that were previously returned under the rejection policies, as we seek to ensure that those affected have a mechanism to restore the original filing dates.&nbsp;If you received a rejection notice dated after December 24, 2020, you can contact counsel for plaintiffs at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bspolicy@nwirp.org">bspolicy@nwirp.org</a>&nbsp; ASISTA is proud to support our partners in this important litigation.</p>

<p>In addition, DOJ finalized their harmful rule on administrative closure as well as the EOIR fee rule.

<![CDATA[<p>Today, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-12-11/pdf/2020-26875.pdf">published a new rule </a>that makes sweeping and devastating changes to asylum. This rule would deny the vast majority of asylum-seekers – including survivors of gender-based violence –  the chance to make their case for protection, let alone to have a fair day in court.  As <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ASISTA-comment-to-Asylum-Proposed-Rule-Final.pdf">ASISTA’s comment to the rule shows</a>, this new asylum rule uniquely harms those fleeing gender-based violence and persecution and ruthlessly diminishes the rights of all asylum seekers to apply for and receive full and fair consideration of their cases. It is scheduled to take effect on January 11, 2021. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>To learn more, read this <a href="https://immigrationimpact.com/2020/12/10/trump-asylum-rule-2021/#.X9OfA-lKj9E">Immigration Impact blog post</a> and read statements from our partners <a href="https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/news/cgrs-decries-sweeping-anti-asylum-regulations-prepares-court-challenge">Center for Gender and Refugee Studies </a>and the <a href="https://1ttls613brjl37btxk4eg60v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tahirih-Statement_Finalized-Regulations-to-End-Asylum_December-10-2020.pdf">Tahirih Justice Center</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-27008.pdf">DOJ has also released a new rule</a>, to be published on December 16, 2020 which if implemented will decimate the availability of administrative closure in Immigration Court proceedings.&nbsp; Administrative closure is a critical docket management tool commonly utilized to ensure that applicants, including survivors, have an opportunity to have their cases decided by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) before their immigration court matter is concluded. <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ASISTA-BIA-regulation-comment-FINAL.pdf">ASISTA strongly opposes this rule,</a> which is set to take effect January 15, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASISTA supports the efforts to challenge these new rules, and will stand with our partners to ensure the Biden-Harris administration safeguards due process and paths to safety and security for immigrant survivors of violence. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), ASISTA and the Domestic Violence Project (DVP) of the Urban Justice Center have published a new practice advisory based on new USCIS documentation obtained by<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=a007347865&amp;e=5a6b864bc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> FOIA litigation brought by Cleary Gottlieb </a>on behalf of DVP.  </p>




<a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background" href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/No-Blanks-Practice-Advisory-11.20.20.pdf">Read Advisory here</a>




<p>This advisory contains a summary of the records USCIS released through the FOIA litigation , as well as a detailed explanation of what USCIS considers to be required fields. In addition, the advisory works through how practitioners can use this information when advocating with USCIS and other strategic considerations for addressing rejections based on USCIS’s “no-blanks” policy. Highlights include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>USCIS has issued two primary guidance documents to aid the mailroom in assessing U visa forms: A Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) guide and a color-coded form. However, the SOP and the color-coded form are sometimes inconsistent with each other.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Due to the blank spaces policy, USCIS rejected 98% of all I-918s submitted between December 30, 2019 and January 17, 2020.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As of October 9, 2020, USCIS has not issued an SOP or color-coded form to reflect the application of the no-blanks policy to I-918 Supplement Bs.</li>
</ul>



<p>We are grateful to the tremendous contributions of Kyle Dandelet (Cleary Gottleib, Chair of the AILA VAWA, U and T Committee), Joy Ziegeweid (DVP), Amy Cheung (ASISTA) and Sharvari Dalal-Dheini (AILA) to this advisory.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On October 13, 2020, ASISTA submitted a comment in response to USCIS <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/11/2020-19145/collection-and-use-of-biometrics-by-us-citizenship-and-immigration-services">harmful new proposed rule</a> that would pose<strong> </strong>significant privacy, confidentiality and safety implications for immigrant survivors of  domestic and sexual violence, human trafficking, and other gender-based abuses. </p>



<p>The proposed rule would change, among other things:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Drastically increase the types of biometric information collected</strong> from those who interact with DHS, even U.S. citizens, who are filing or associated with an immigration benefit, request, or enforcement, to include iris images, palm and voice prints, and DNA</li>
<li>
<strong>Change evidentiary requirements</strong> for VAWA Self-Petitioners and T visa holders applying for their green card as evidence of good moral character. </li>
<li>
<strong>Unlawfully expand the “lookback” period</strong> of good moral character determinations for VAWA self-petitions and T adjustment applications </li>
<li>
<strong>Eliminate the presumption of good moral character </strong>for those under 14 years old who are seeking status as VAWA Self-Petitioners and T visa adjustment.</li>
<li> <strong>Creates harmful  “continuous vetting” procedures</strong> in which individuals may “be subjected to continued and subsequent evaluation of eligibility for their immigration benefits to ensure they continue to present no risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry.”</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[<p>ASISTA, like you, is horrified at the allegations of medical abuse and neglect inflicted on women in immigration custody. As we support our partners in ensuring that these atrocities are investigated immediately, we are grateful for the relentless work of these organizations on the ground:<a href="https://projectsouth.org/"> <strong>Project South</strong>
</a>,<a href="https://gadetentionwatch.wordpress.com/"> <strong>Georgia Detention Watch</strong>
</a>,<a href="https://glahr.org/"> <strong>Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights</strong>
</a>, and<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sogaisnetwork/"> <strong>South Georgia Immigrant Support Network</strong>
</a>. We are also grateful for the brave efforts of nurse Dawn Wooten, who brought these horrific abuses to light.</p>



<p>The abuse detailed in the<a href="https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OIG-ICDC-Complaint-1.pdf"> complaint</a> filed with the Office of the Inspector General fits a pattern of racist mistreatment that is endemic in immigration detention centers. Immigration and Custom Patrol (ICE) has proven, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/30/ice-parole-coronavirus/">again</a> and<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/prisoners-rights/rampant-abuses-immigration-detention-prove-ice-rotten-core"> again</a>, that they do not prioritize the health and safety of people in detention, which has only worsened during the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp; These most recent allegations in this complaint demonstrate that immigration detention centers are a breeding grounds for violence, abuse and neglect. Immigration officials have been accused of<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrant-ice-rape-lawsuit"> rape</a> inside detention cells,<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/11/immigration-detention-sexual-abuse-ice-dhs/"> filmed</a> women as they showered, and threatened victims in their custody<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/15/ice-deport-witness-sexual-assault/"> with deportation</a> if they spoke out about the sexual abuse they experienced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We demand justice and accountability. The only way to keep detained individuals safe during a global pandemic is to release them. We all need to speak out now. By coming together and using our collective power, we can hold ICE accountable and start building a society free from this Administration’s cruelty—where families aren’t separated, and immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.&nbsp;</p>

Laura Flores Bachman, Senior Legal Counsel with ASISTA, was quoted in this article about these heinous acts, “We believe sexual assaults in ICE facilities are crimes that are all too often unchecked given the deep vulnerability and isolation of detained immigrant women. We are hopeful that both local and federal officials will conduct a thorough investigation into these serious allegations and put an end to victims’ unabated suffering in the shadows of ICE detention.” <a href="https://diario.mx/el-paso/amp/revelan-abuso-sexual-detenidos-por-ice-20200814-1696877.html">See article here</a>

<![CDATA[<p>In an effort to help our members avoid filing rejections for work authorization&nbsp;applications, we want to make sure everyone is aware of the upcoming changes to the I-765 and&nbsp;I-765WS forms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>USCIS has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated Forms I-765 and I-765WS</a>.&nbsp;The new editions of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-765-aead.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Application for Employment Authorization</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-765ws-aead.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worksheet</a>&nbsp;will go into effect&nbsp;<strong>on August 25, 2020.</strong>
</p>



<p>The&nbsp;new I-765 and I-765WS will go live on August 25, 2020 as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>USCIS will continue to accept the current forms edition dated 12/26/2019 only if your filing is postmarked&nbsp;<strong>
<u>before</u>
</strong>&nbsp;August 25, 2020.</li>
<li>USCIS will&nbsp;<strong>only</strong>&nbsp;accept the new 8/25/2020 edition for filings postmarked&nbsp;<strong>on or after</strong>&nbsp;August 25, 2020.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<em>
<strong>Note</strong>: The content in this alert may evolve in the next two weeks.&nbsp;Changes to the forms are based on the recently published USCIS final rules on work authorization for asylum&nbsp;seekers. There is&nbsp;<a href="https://asylumadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Casa-de-Maryland-v.-Wolf-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pending federal litigation</a>&nbsp;challenging the implementation of the rules, which includes a motion for preliminary injunction&nbsp;to enjoin the implementation of the rules pending the outcome of the litigation.&nbsp;</em>

Currently, this policy applies to asylum seekers, as well as U and T visa applicants, all forms of relief for vulnerable populations.  We call on USCIS to end this harmful policy that causes needless barriers for applicants, the advocates who serve them, as well as U visa certifying agencies. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong> May 19 2020</p>



<p>
<strong>Contact: </strong>Ahlam Moussa</p>



<p>On Thursday, April 30, ASISTA and the Immigration Center for Women and Children (ICWC) filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California demanding that USCIS and DHS disclose information requested related to their exercise of discretion in adjudicating adjustment of status (green card) applications by crime victims who have been granted a U visa.</p>



<p>The bipartisan U visa program was created by Congress in 2000 to provide a path to legal immigration status for noncitizen survivors of crimes who are helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crimes against them. A key component of the U visa program is that if USCIS approves the U visa, the crime survivor can eventually apply for permanent residence (green card).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past two years, immigration lawyers have noticed an alarming increase in USCIS’s requests for documents related to crime victims’ criminal history even where they had never been charged or convicted of any crime or where the underlying conduct had already been disclosed and waived during the U visa filing process. In some cases, USCIS has used these documents to deny the adjustment application. This new practice, coupled with USCIS’s refusal to publicly share the agency’s adjudications guidance and criteria, has left crime victims and their families, along with their representatives, uncertain about how USCIS is deciding these applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASISTA and ICWC, which are represented&nbsp;<em>pro bono&nbsp;</em>in this suit by Van Der Hout LLP, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking information on USCIS’s policies on these practices on November 22, 2019, which USCIS has failed to answer. We have now filed suit to force USCIS to comply with its obligation to respond to our FOIA request.</p>



<p>Gail Pendleton, Executive Director of ASISTA states: “Survivors of crime deserve transparency and accountability from USCIS. This new policy is one more strategy in this Administration’s ongoing war against immigrants and is a blatant attempt to undercut Congress’s bipartisan efforts to protect crime victims.”</p>



<p>A copy of the filing is available&nbsp;<a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=66f12949b18917e90534335f0bfeb16f6m19382566f&amp;secureId=okMG8WJBqsCy1nw%2FPb67Ow%3D%3D&amp;linkId=4212&amp;targetUrl=https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Complaint-for-Declaratory-and-Injunctive-Relief-under-FOIA-4302020.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> April 23, 2020</p>



<p>Media <strong>Contact:</strong> Ahlam Moussa, ASISTA, <a href="mailto:ahlam@asistahelp.org">ahlam@asistahelp.org</a>
</p>



<p>ASISTA denounces President Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-immigrants-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-economic-recovery-following-covid-19-outbreak/">new executive order</a> temporarily limiting entry for individuals outside the US seeking permanent residency, as it only serves to sow hatred and create division. It needlessly separates families, including <a href="https://asistahelp.org/impact-of-latest-executive-order-on-survivor-based-forms-of-immigration-benefits/">certain family members of survivors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States is in the middle of a global public health crisis, which has affected over 800,000 individuals and caused over 44,000 deaths nationwide. Instead of correcting its failures managing the COVID-19 pandemic, the Administration continues its familiar tactic of divide and distract by needlessly scapegoating immigrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This order comes as the Administration continues to put <a href="https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20DHS%20-%20Border%20Closure%20DV%20Survivors_4_16_2020%20Corrected.pdf">asylum seekers lives at risk at the border</a>, continues to risk lives by<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/coronavirus-ice-richwood-deportations/"> sustaining its enforcement and detention activities</a>, and continues to cause <a href="https://asistahelp.org/uscis-must-do-more-to-protect-immigrant-survivors/">hardship for immigrants who are filing for immigration relief.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;ASISTA is proud to stand with the millions of immigrants on the front lines working to protect this country during this unprecedented crisis. We call on the Administration and Congress to focus its efforts on combating the COVID-19 virus instead of xenophobic political plays serving only to create division and distraction.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>by: Cecelia Friedman Levin, ASISTA Policy Director with Grace Huang, Policy Director, Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-based Violence</em>
</p>



<p>Yesterday, President Trump signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-immigrants-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-economic-recovery-following-covid-19-outbreak/">an executive order </a>temporarily halting<strong> entry </strong>of certain individuals seeking to enter the U.S. on immigrant visas (as permanent residents) for 60 days. The order will be effective as of 11:59 pm ET on April 23, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The order covers <strong>ONLY </strong>those who are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>outside the United States;</li>
<li>do not have an immigrant visa that is valid as of 11:59 pm ET on April 23, 2020 <strong>and</strong>
</li>
<li>do not have an official travel document other than a visa (such as a transportation letter, an appropriate boarding foil, or an advance parole document) that is valid as of 11:59 pm ET on April 23, 2020 or issued on any date thereafter that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission.</li>
</ul>



<p>The order lists the following categories as exemptions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Legal Permanent Residents;</li>
<li>Spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens (those under 21), including prospective adoptees;</li>
<li>Members of the U.S. military and their spouses and children;</li>
<li>Medical health professionals seeking to assist with COVID-19 response or&nbsp;<ul>
<li>those coming to perform “work essential to combatting, recovering from or otherwise alleviating the effects of COVID-19 and their immediate relatives (spouses, unmarried children under 21). This designation will be determined by&nbsp; the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State (DOS).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Employment Based immigrant investors</li>
<li>Afghani or Iraqi interpreters or others who have worked for US government</li>
<li>Others designated by State Dept, DHS whose entry&nbsp; is in the national interest or whose entry would further important law enforcement objectives in the United States.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Who is impacted?</strong>
</p>



<p>The executive order would cover the following categories of individuals seeking to enter the United States on an immigrant visa</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>parents and adult children (over 21) of U.S. Citizens,&nbsp;</li>
<li>spouses and children of green card holders;</li>
<li>diversity visa applicants</li>
<li>Most immigrant visas based on employment</li>
</ul>



<p>These categories of individuals would not be able to obtain visas to enter for at least the 60 day period of the order.&nbsp; Even those family members who have a valid visa <strong>
<em>but do not also have a valid travel document </em>
</strong>would not be able to enter the United States unless they fall under one of the noted exceptions. The <a href="https://twitter.com/MigrationPolicy/status/1253111954429878274?s=20">Migration Policy Institute </a>estimates this order would block about 26,000 green cards a month or 52,000 over the 60 days of the proclamation. The impact of the executive order would be increasingly more significant if the Administration were to extend it beyond this initial 60 day period, and could impact over <a href="https://www.boundless.com/blog/trump-immigration-ban-who-is-affected/">350,000 green card cases</a> per year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to survivor-based relief under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), the following could be directly impacted by the order <strong>
<em>if they are abroad and seeking to enter the U.S under the following categories:</em>
</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An approved I-929 Petition for Qualifying Family Member for U-1 Nonimmigrant</li>
<li>An approved VAWA self-petition based on abuse by a LPR spouse or parent</li>
<li>An approved VAWA self-petition based on being an abused parent of an abusive U.S. Citizen son or daughter.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Who is not impacted by this order?</strong>
</p>



<p>USCIS will continue to accept and process applications and petitions, and the executive order does not change that. Keep in mind that USCIS has temporarily suspended in-person services through at least May 3, 2020, including in-person interviews and biometrics processing, though the agency will provide emergency services for limited in-person situations. The executive order does not impact survivors who are applying for immigration benefits like VAWA self-petitions or for a U or T visa or other forms of adjustment of status<strong> that are currently inside the United States</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The executive order does not completely stop all immigration into the United States; it does not apply to those individuals who are abroad seeking to enter on nonimmigrant visas, this includes U and T visas, which are a nonimmigrant classification status.&nbsp; However, the executive order does contain instructions to DHS and the Department of Labor (DOL) to consult with DOS within the next 30 days to “review nonimmigrant programs” and make recommendations regarding how to “stimulate the United States economy and ensure the prioritization, hiring, and employment of United States workers.”&nbsp; So, it is likely that other forms of nonimmigrant status may come under additional review at a later date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of State has already<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-routine-visa-services.html"> suspended routine visa services worldwide</a> and consulates are subject to local government restrictions. During the COVID-19 crisis, consulates are providing emergency and “mission critical” services, including <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/update-on-h-and-j-visas-for-medical-professionals.html">for medical professionals</a>, and H-2 visa holders.&nbsp; Thus under the current policy, It is unlikely that the consulates would be processing immigrant visas based on VAWA relief during the COVID-19 crisis unless it is emergency processing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Bottom line:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p> As advocates, it is important to be messengers to survivors we serve to let them know that it is unlikely this executive order would impact the processing of applications like VAWA self-petitions, U and T visas if they are applying from here in the United States.  </p>

<![CDATA[<p>On April 7, 2020, ASISTA supplemented <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-24-ASISTA-Letter-to-USCIS-on-COVID-19.pdf">its initial letter t</a>o USCIS regarding its recommendations in light of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking and other serious crimes already face myriad barriers accessing services and assistance, and these barriers have been exacerbated during this unprecedented emergency.  We call on USCIS to take additional steps to ensure that survivors can fully access protections during this COVID-19 crisis.  </p>

<![CDATA[<p>(New York, February 25, 2020) – Safe Horizon and ASISTA have filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for immigration policy data on the adjudication of U-visa petitions and adjustment of status (permanent residence) applications for those granted U visa status. &nbsp;</p>



<p>U visas were created by a bi-partisan congress in 2000 to protect immigrant victims of serious crimes who assist law enforcement in detecting, investigating and prosecuting crime. Beginning in 2018, Safe Horizon’s Immigration Law Project and ASISTA observed a shift in USCIS’s adjudication of U-visa petitions and U-visa permanent residence applications for applicants with prior contact with law enforcement.&nbsp; Safe Horizon’s Immigration Law Project and ASISTA observed an increase in USCIS requests and reliance on copies of applicants’ arrest records even where charges were never filed, charges were dismissed, and/or where the records were sealed.&nbsp; Prior to this time, USCIS generally accepted certified copies of a certificate of disposition.</p>



<p>USCIS has not issued any revised practice or policy information regarding this shift.&nbsp; As a result of the paucity of public information, many members of the public, including immigration lawyers, advocates for noncitizens, social workers, and law enforcement personnel, lack an understanding of the current practice and policy governing U-visa adjudications, the rationales that underlie it, and how to develop best practices for their work.</p>



<p>Safe Horizon and ASISTA requested records relating to USCIS’ policy on the adjudication of U-visa petitions and applications for adjustment of status based on an underlying U-visa from 2015 to present. Safe Horizon and ASISTA also requested USCIS policies from 2015 to present on the relevance of an applicant’s prior contact with law enforcement in the adjudication of U-visa petitions and applications for adjustment of status based on an underlying U-visa.</p>



<p>“This data is needed to provide a minimum level of transparency on USCIS’ practices as it relates to a critical form of immigration relief for survivors of violence and abuse,” said&nbsp;Evangeline M. Chan, Esq., Director of Safe Horizon’s Immigration Law Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laura Flores Bachman, ASISTA Senior Legal Counsel said, “As leading advocates for immigrant survivors of violence, ASISTA has seen a significant shift in the way USCIS is adjudicating U visa petitions and U visa permanent residence applications. The documents we requested from USCIS will hopefully shed light on the way the agency has shifted its focus in these adjudications, creating more obstacles for immigrant survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, human trafficking and other serious crimes.”</p>



<p>Attorneys from Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP are representing Safe Horizon and ASISTA on a pro bono basis in this FOIA request.&nbsp;</p>

This significant shift in policy and practice creates enormous hardship for survivors and their families, and strains valuable resources for service providers and U visa certifying agencies.  We call on USCIS to immediately withdraw the announcement and to accept and receipt in all I-918 applications that were rejected pursuant to the I-918 Alert and restore their initial filing date <em>nunc pro tunc</em>. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>
</p>



<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong>&nbsp;February 13, 2020</p>



<p>
<strong>Contact:&nbsp;</strong>Ahlam Moussa,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cecelia@asistahelp.org">ahlam@asistahelp.org</a>
<br>
</p>



<p>Changes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy were announced August 2, 2019 that create significant additional barriers for victims of crime who cooperate with law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of their crimes. ASISTA, represented by Protect Democracy and the Constitutional Accountability Center, filed suit today in Connecticut to challenge the legality of this policy and to show the harm it presents to victims who are U visa petitioners nationwide.</p>



<p>ASISTA challenges this policy based on the fact that Acting ICE Director Matthew Albence, who signed off on this new ICE Directive, was serving illegally in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and federal statutes.&nbsp; The law requires that the Director of ICE be confirmed by the Senate; however, there has not been a Senate-confirmed ICE Director for more than three years now. ICE must be held accountable for violating the law, and for creating barriers for immigrant survivors of violence seeking protection and relief.</p>



<p>
<strong>Gail Pendleton, Executive Director of ASISTA states,&nbsp;</strong>“This new policy is an egregious attack on due process. It serves as another example of this Administration’s attempt to erode, through policy changes, the bipartisan protections Congress created and expanded for immigrant survivors over the past 25 years. Deporting survivors of rape, kidnapping, domestic violence and other serious crimes who help law enforcement makes our communities much less safe.”</p>



<p>
<strong>Cecelia Friedman Levin, ASISTA’s Policy Director states,</strong>&nbsp;“This new ICE policy exposes immigrant survivors of crime who come forward to help law enforcement to precisely the risk they sought to avoid and from which a bipartisan majority in Congress sought to protect them.”</p>



<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
</p>



<p>The new ICE policy changed the process and criteria by which ICE would consider a “stay of removal” for victims of crime who are eligible for U visas. &nbsp; The bipartisan U visa program was created by Congress in 2000 to provide a path to legal immigration status for noncitizen survivors of crimes who are helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crimes against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new ICE guidance eliminates important procedural safeguards, which will lead to an increased risk that survivors will be deported before their cases are decided. Unlike the prior policy which encouraged stays of deportation for U visa applicants for meritorious applications, this new guidance leaves decisions up to individual ICE officers to consider the “totality of the circumstances” including evaluating “any federal interests implicated” in deciding whether halting deportation is appropriate.&nbsp; This new vague standard creates inconsistent and arbitrary results for survivors with pending U visa matters.</p>



<p>A copy of the filing is available <a href="https://asista.z2systems.com/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=asista&amp;emailId=e2f39213f5c40ff32f56dfd682eb005eem219924e2f&amp;secureId=HUPCVNDERKtm9wlN0AAAWQ%3D%3D&amp;linkId=3316&amp;targetUrl=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6775588-1-Complaint-02132020.html">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On December 30, 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)&#160;placed an alert on their website&#160;for Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, stating: Alert: We may reject your Form I-918 or your Form I-918 Supplement A if you leave a field blank, unless the field is optional.&#160;Optional fields include the safe mailing address as well&#8230;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On December 30, 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-918">placed an alert on their website</a>&nbsp;for Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, stating:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Alert: We may reject your Form I-918 or your Form I-918 Supplement A if you leave a field blank, unless the field is optional.</strong>&nbsp;Optional fields include the safe mailing address as well as fields you should only complete if you answered yes to a previous question. You must provide a response to all other questions, even if the response is “none,” “unknown” or “n/a.”&nbsp; We will reject a Form I-918 or a Form I-918 Supplement A that has, for example, an empty field for middle name, for current immigration status, or for information pertaining to a spouse or child.</li>
</ul>



<p>With this alert, USCIS continues its draconian agenda of limiting access to protections for the most vulnerable. USCIS has unjustly singled out U visas applicants&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/23/us-immigration-trump-asylum-seekers">as it has in the past with asylum seekers</a>. ASISTA will vehemently push back against this change in procedure. and we will provide updates as they become available. In the interim, ASISTA has developed the following practice pointers to minimize the risk of rejection.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On Friday November 22, 2019, the <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9th-Circuit-Courts-of-Appeal-Perez-Perez-Decision.pdf">9th Circuit Court of Appeals published a decision</a> reversing the district court’s dismissal of a suit challenging a U visa petition denial for lack of jurisdiction. The panel held that § 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) do not bar judicial review of U visa petition denials: </p>



<p>“The discretionary denials are difficult in light of 242(a)(2)(B), and probably not&nbsp;challengeable&nbsp;in many courts.&nbsp; Arguably, however, a “discretionary decision” that fails to apply governing standards or fails to follow governing precedent decisions is not really a “discretionary decision” and should be reviewable.&nbsp; A good case is <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HERNANDEZ-v.-ASHCROFT-9th-cir-2003.pdf">Hernandez v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 824 (9th Cir. 2003)</a>“</p>



<p>This decision is encouraging as ASISTA works with attorneys across the country to bring APA suits against DHS on various issues involving&nbsp;survivors’ access to immigration benefits. We encourage anyone interested in representing their clients before federal courts on U visa/VAWA/T visa benefits to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sejal@asistahelp.org">contact ASISTA’s Litigation Counsel, Sejal Zota,</a>&nbsp;for support and mentorship. You can also<a href="mailto:questions@asistahelp.org">&nbsp;contact us</a>&nbsp;to join our U Visa Litigation listserve&nbsp;where practitioners&nbsp;come together to share invaluable litigation strategy.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>ASISTA stridently opposes the proposed fee rule published in the<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=4d193622a3&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Federal Register</a>&nbsp;yesterday as it further advances the Administration’s callous agenda to create significant barriers to equal access to immigration relief. The new proposed rule makes sweeping changes, including but not limited to:</p>



<p>
<strong>I. Fee Increases</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An increase in fees for N-400 naturalization application, from $640 to $1,170 (83% increase)&nbsp;</li>
<li>An increase in fees for&nbsp; I-929: Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U–1 Nonimmigrant,&nbsp; $230 to $1515 (an increase of 559%).</li>
<li>An increase in fees for I-485: Application for Adjustment of Status&nbsp;</li>
<li>A new fee for affirmative asylum applications and increase in fees for DACA renewal requests.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>II. Elimination of Fee Waivers for Many Applications</strong>
</p>



<p>The new rule also calls for the elimination of fee waivers for many applications including N-400, I-90, I-765, I-485 and I-751; however, fee waivers for forms related to VAWA self-petitioners (including I-751 waivers based on domestic violence and VAWA cancellation), U visa and T visa applications, battered spouses of certain nonimmigrant visa holders under INA §106, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS)<strong>are statutorily mandated by Congress and cannot be eliminated by agency action.**</strong>
<br>
<br>Even before this new fee rule was published, USCIS had taken action to limit <strong>
<em>the criteria </em>
</strong>to determine fee waiver eligibility through its revisions to the I-912 fee waiver form and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=c630888223&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank"> corresponding guidance</a>, which will create significant <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=7921ff3d4f&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank">barriers for immigrants, including survivors of violence</a>. While those changes are currently being challenged<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=b36a6fa075&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank"> through litigation efforts</a>, the new proposed fee rule published yesterday further limits the criteria for fee waivers, as those seeking fee waivers based on the federal poverty guidelines will now need to demonstrate that they earn less than 125% of the federal poverty guidelines, rather than the current level of 150%.  The proposed rule also eliminates the financial hardship criteria for fee waivers.</p>



<p>
<br>
<strong>III. Transferring Funds to ICE</strong>
</p>



<p>In addition, the new fee rule calls for over $200 million to be transferred to ICE, citing their role in investigating and enforcing laws related to potential immigration fraud. It is unconscionable that immigrants applying for immigration benefits should shoulder the financial burden of transforming USCIS into a third enforcement arm of DHS.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:center">
<strong>TIME TO TAKE ACTION</strong>
<br>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=2ca082f71c&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there have been advocacy efforts to seek an extension,</a>&nbsp;the deadline for comment on this significant proposed rule is&nbsp;<strong>December 16, 2019.</strong>In the upcoming days, ASISTA will be sending out template comments and sharing additional resources for organizations that serve immigrant survivors of domestic and sexual violence to voice their strong opposition to this new rule.&nbsp; We will also be posting updates on<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=00e612487f&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;ASISTA’s Fee Waiver Advocacy Page.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on the new proposed rule,<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=4a27120ec2&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;[click here] f</a>or a factsheet developed by NALEO. For additional background on the proposed fee schedule, from CLINIC<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=691f90c52c&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;[click here]</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;For further questions on this proposed rule, contact ASISTA at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions@asistahelp.org?subject=Question%20on%20Proposed%20Fee%20Rule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questions@asistahelp.org&nbsp;</a>
</p>



<p>** For example, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, specifically stated that DHS&nbsp;<strong>
<em>shall permit applicants to apply for a waiver of any fees associated&nbsp;</em>
</strong>with filing a VAWA self-petition, a T or U visa application, or an application for VAWA cancellation or suspension of deportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of November, two lawsuits were filed challenging the <a href="http://immigrationimpact.com/2019/10/30/uscis-changes-fee-waivers-policy/#.XeFDZDJKjOQ">harmful revisions to USCIS fee waiver forms</a>. USCIS’ new revisions limit the criteria for fee waivers and increase burdens on low-income applicants applying for immigration relief. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public Citizen on behalf of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Network field a suit in the U.S. District Court for DC against USCIS for its failure to comply with federal rulemaking requirements. For more information, see Public Citizen’s press release <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.citizen.org/news/new-restrictions-on-waivers-of-immigration-filing-fees-are-unlawful/" target="_blank">here</a>.  You can view their complaint <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.citizen.org/litigation/northwest-immigrant-rights-project-v-u-s-citizenship-and-immigration-services/" target="_blank">here</a>, and amended complaint <a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/9.Amended-complaint.pdf">here</a>. This lawsuit highlights the impact that the fee waiver changes will have on naturalization, applications for legal permanent residency and humanitarian protections for victims of crime. </li>
<li>Similarly,  Protect Democracy, Advancing Justice-AAJC and partners brought a suit forward in California on behalf of ILRC, CLINIC, the City of Seattle among other plaintiffs. This suit challenges the revisions to the fee waiver form, as it will make it harder for low-income legal permanent residents to naturalize and for other applicants to access other immigration benefits. Please find their press statement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://protectdemocracy.org/project/city-of-seattle-v-dhs/" target="_blank">here</a>, and their complaint <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://protectdemocracy.org/resource-library/document/complaint-city-of-seattle-v-dhs/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re grateful for these organizations bringing these important actions forward. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>In September 2019, ICE responded to a letter sent by Representative Julián Castro (TX-20) and several other members of Congress about the guidance changes regarding stay of removal processes for U visa applicants. In the letter it mentions several points:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>ICE may join a motion to terminate for U visa applicants in removal proceedings and those with final orders may request a stay. </li>
<li>Outlining the new ICE guidance stay requests for U visa applicants, confirming that ICE is no longer required to contact USCIS for prima facie determination on a case. Instead, individual ICE officers will exercise their individual discretion based on the “totality of the circumstances” (See more about this harmful policy <a href="https://asistahelp.org/policy-update-changes-in-ice-guidance-will-impede-access-to-protections-for-immigrant-survivors-of-violence/">here</a>).</li>
<li>The letter confirms that the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/prosecutorial-discretion/certain-victims-witnesses-plaintiffs.pdf">2011 ICE Memo on Prosecutorial Discretion for Certain Victims, Witnesses and Plaintiffs </a>remains in effect. </li>
</ul>

<p>Though this letter reiterates much of the problematic language on this new directive <a href="https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/revision-stay-removal-request-reviews-u-visa-petitioners">as it has before</a>, advocates can use the language of the letter in their advocacy with ICE on behalf of survivors, showing that ICE does have the authority to utilize prosecutorial discretion on behalf of victims, with direct confirmation that the language of the 2011 guidance remains in effect and should be considered.  Please keep us posted at questions@asistahelp.org with any advocacy updates. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>On August 8, 2019 the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=83588e59f4&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a second opportunity&nbsp;for notice&nbsp;</a>
<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=7b128613d0&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and comment&nbsp;</a>on the new USCIS Tip Form to collect information from the public regarding purported immigration fraud.</p>



<p>At ASISTA, we are concerned about the USCIS Tip Form as it represents another tool for abusers and perpetrators of crime to weaponize the immigration system against survivors, without consequence or repercussion. This is extremely problematic and dangerous, as abusers often use the threat of deportation as a tool to maintain power and control over survivors.</p>



<p>
<strong>We urge you&nbsp;and&nbsp;your organization to submit comments detailing your opposition to this proposed form.</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;The comment period closes September 9, 2019.</strong>
</p>



<p>ASISTA, ILRC and the Arab American Institute have developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=cb73c92272&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comprehensive fact sheet</a>&nbsp;on the proposed USCIS Tip Form. In addition, you can use this updated&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=083cb0ef39&amp;e=329740afc0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">template comment</a>&nbsp;to speak out against this harmful form. We are grateful to ILRC, CLINIC, and Democracy Forward for their contributions to this template.</p>



<a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-background has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color" href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=083cb0ef39&amp;e=329740afc0" style="color:#ffffff">Access Updated Template Here</a>



<p>Using the template as a starting point,&nbsp;agencies<strong>&nbsp;should individualize their comments with their own reasons and experiences why the proposed form would harm immigrant survivors and their families so that they may be counted as a unique submission</strong>.<br>
<br>In addition, to the extent possible, your comment submission should be in your own words and based upon your agency’s concerns and interests.&nbsp; Even if you submitted a comment before, you can comment again raising some of the new issues addressed in this updated template.&nbsp;<strong>The goal is to maximize the number of unique comments to have the greatest impact.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<br>
<strong>Deadline for submission is&nbsp;September 9, 2019.&nbsp;Comments can be submitted via email to:&nbsp;</strong>
<em>
<a href="mailto:dhsdeskofficer@omb.eop.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dhsdeskofficer@omb.eop.gov</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em>All submissions&nbsp; must include the agency name and OMB Control Number 1615-NEW&nbsp;in the subject line. For example: “Agency-USCIS:&nbsp;OMB Control Number 1615-NEW, Comment in Opposition to USCIS Tip Form”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Be sure to also include your name and your agency in the body of the comment.&nbsp;For more information on how to file, click&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a408799070a32116b9970196&amp;id=dda60c66f3&amp;e=329740afc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>

<strong>&nbsp;Please remember to review and clear any formatting before submission. &nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>Also, CLINIC has developed a tool for individuals to submit comment in opposition to the harmful USCIS Tip Form.

</description>
										<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>Late last Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released <a href="https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/revision-stay-removal-request-reviews-u-visa-petitioners">a new fact sheet</a>  outlining when they will grant “stays” of deportation to crime victims who have cooperated with law enforcement investigations applying for a U visa.  This new guidance will create enormous barriers for survivors of violence; it eliminates critical procedural safeguards and will lead to an increased risk that survivors may face deportation before their cases are decided.  <strong>While ICE has issued a fact sheet on this new policy, it has not yet released the actual policy directive for the public to review. </strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Background: </strong>The fact sheet states that ICE has <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/dro_policy_memos/11005_1-hd-stay_requests_filed_by_u_visa_applicants.pdf">replaced long-standing</a> guidance which laid out the process ICE should follow in adjudicating stays for U visa applicants in removal proceedings and in immigration detention. Specifically, ICE was required to reach out to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to determine whether the applicant has established a “prima facie” case. If they did, then ICE could “favorably view” a victim’s request for a stay of removal (absent certain adverse factors). </p>



<p>
<strong>New
changes: </strong>The “prima facie” determination process outlined in the prior
guidance has been replaced by a “totality of the circumstances” framework,
instructing individual ICE officers to consider positive or negative factors
and “any federal interest(s) implicated” to decide whether halting deportation
is appropriate. ASISTA is deeply concerned that this new standard is vague and
will not improve this important process for survivors. </p>



<p>
<strong>Legal
obstacles:</strong> Federal statute specifically mentions the “prima facie” analysis
when considering U visa applicants’ stay requests.<a href="#_edn1">
<sup>[i]</sup>
</a> ICE cannot
simply swap this Congressionally-established prima facie standard for a
totality of the circumstances standard. Furthermore, the fact sheet indicates
that ICE will no longer have to receive input from those government officials
with specialized training in survivor-based cases. Untrained in trauma-informed
practice, and in the dynamics of domestic and sexual violence, these agents
will determine a survivor’s&nbsp; “totality of
the circumstances” as well as what “federal interests will be considered.” This
will result in inconsistent adjudications of stay requests, an erosion of due
process and limits on access to protections for survivors. It will cause
additional hardship, both for the agency and the advocacy community, to address
the erratic outcomes of this new guidance.&nbsp;
For survivors, the consequences are dire. Survivors fleeing abusive
relationships may not have documents available to help support a “totality of
the circumstances framework” and the trauma they endured due to their
victimization is compounded enormously by the risk of deportation.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The fact sheet also contains provisions for victims on the U visa waitlist and those granted U visa status, stating “It is ICE policy to respect USCIS’ grant of deferred action to a U visa waitlisted petitioner.”<a href="#_edn2">
<sup>[ii]</sup>
</a> Waitlisted victims and approved survivors should not have to endure the hardship and uncertainty of being in removal proceedings. </p>



<p>
<strong>Creating
Additional Barriers: </strong>ASISTA remains deeply concerned about ICE
abandoning its prior guidance. The new policy will increase ICE’s disparate
treatment of requests to halt deportation for crime victims cooperating with
law enforcement investigations. USCIS currently has an egregious backlog in the
adjudication of U visa applications and the processing times for U visa cases
is listed to be between 51.5 and 52 months<a href="#_edn3">
<sup>[iii]</sup>
</a> from the
time of filing to consideration on the waitlist. Such long waits, coupled with
ICE’s harmful new policy,&nbsp; mean that
survivors who cooperate with law enforcement to increase public safety will now
risk potential deportation before their cases are ever heard. </p>



<p>Deporting immigrant crime victims who
have been certified as helpful to law enforcement directly contravenes the
purpose of these bipartisan protections established by Congress.&nbsp; We call on ICE to re-establish the prima

immigrant crime survivors while their applications are pending. We urge
Congress to hold the Department of Homeland Security accountable for diminishing
access to critical protections for victims of crime. <br>

<![CDATA[<p>It is beyond overwhelming to track the myriad ways, large and small, in which DHS’ policy is eroding access to critical immigration protections, including those designed to protect immigrant crime survivors. Sometimes these policy changes don’t grab headlines, but they all contribute to DHS’ calculated and callous plan to weaken existing paths to immigration benefits. Given our mission and expertise, ASISTA is deeply concerned about these policy changes as they often diminish access to immigration protections for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. </p>



<p>One recent example of these changes is the publication of DHS’ updated<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0731_uscis_u-visa-law-enforcement-resource-guide.pdf"> U visa Law Enforcement Resource Guide</a> (Updated Guide) released last week. The Updated Guide provides guidance to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) regarding the U visa requirements and the law enforcement certification process.<a href="#_edn1">
<sup>[i]</sup>
</a> <a href="http://niwaplibrary.wcl.american.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/IMM-Gov-DHSUVisaCertificationGuide.pdf">In the past,</a> the resource guide had been a useful tool for advocates to engage LEAs about the U visa program so that they could learn more about its requirements and procedures.&nbsp; However, the new Updated Guide reflects DHS’ blatant effort to encourage LEAs to limit their issuance of U visa certifications for eligible victims. </p>



<p>Several of DHS’ new
recommendations to LEAs in the Updated Guide create unnecessary barriers for
survivors to access U visa certifications, conflict with existing authority and
contravene bipartisan Congressional intent in establishing this critical
protection. Here are just a few examples of these barriers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Encouraging LEAs to conduct background checks on those seeking U visa
certifications:</strong> <a href="http://niwaplibrary.wcl.american.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/IMM-Gov-DHSUVisaCertificationGuide.pdf">Previous
versions of the DHS Certification Guide</a>
<a href="http://niwaplibrary.wcl.american.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/IMM-Gov-DHSUVisaCertificationGuide.pdf"> </a>indicate
that USCIS’ would be the agency responsible for conducting background checks on
U visa applicants; however, the updated guide<strong>
<em> repeatedly<a href="#_edn2">
<strong>[ii]</strong>
</a> </em>
</strong>recommends
LEAs conduct their own “discretionary background checks” on those seeking U
visa certifications, and that they should share their findings with USCIS.&nbsp; At best, this suggestion is duplicative of
USCIS’ own procedures, but at worst, it needlessly suggests&nbsp; that LEAs limit their issuance of U visa
certifications.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Encouraging time limits on certifications.</strong> DHS
suggests that LEAs consider “whether the agency will establish specific
parameters related to certifying cases where a significant amount of time has
passed since commission of the crimes” when in fact the statute and the
regulations establish no statute of limitations on signing U visa
certifications.<a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a> Often
times, survivors may not know that U visa protections exist, or else may be
impacted by the trauma following their victimization to learn more about the
program. This suggestion is <em>ultra vires</em>
to the U visa statute and regulations and counter to DHS purported dedication
to “promoting a Victim-Centered Approach.”<a href="#_edn4">[iv]</a>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Encouraging Withdrawals.</strong> The Updated Guide also
emphasizes that LEAs may withdraw or disavow certifications at any time if “<em>they later discover information regarding
the victim, crime, or certification that your agency believes USCIS should be
aware of<strong>.”<a href="#_edn5">
<strong>[v]</strong>
</a> </strong>
</em>&nbsp;This overbroad and vague recommendation is
deeply irresponsible, and serves to undermine access to U visa relief.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, the updated guide advances DHS’s efforts to eviscerate the U visa program and is part and parcel of DHS’ overall mission to reduce legal immigration to the United States. It is hard enough for immigrant survivors to come forward to seek assistance from law enforcement, given that abusers often threaten that reaching out for help will result in their deportation. Instead of undermining access to critical victim protections, DHS should focus on ways to <strong>
<em>actually</em>
</strong> promote a victim-centered approach<br>
</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>
<a href="#_ednref1">
<sup>[i]</sup>
</a> U visas were created by a bipartisan majority
in Congress in 2000 as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA)
with the dual purpose of strengthening public safety efforts by encouraging
immigrant victims to come forward to report crimes to law enforcement, and to
provide protection to those who come forward. Applicants applying for U visa
relief must submit a certification from an agency or judge that demonstrates
they were a victim of a crime and that they were, are or will be helpful in the
investigation or prosecution of a qualifying criminal activity. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>ASISTA condemns the Administration’s plans for mass raids, now<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/us/politics/ice-families-deport.html"> slated to start this Su</a>
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/mass-immigration-raids-set-begin-sunday-n1028681">nday</a>. These mass immigration enforcement actions create  immense fear in communities nationwide. For immigrant survivors of violence, these raids exacerbate the trauma and fear they already endure because of the abuse they have experienced. </p>



<p>Advocates can help address this fear by providing critical know your rights information and sharing ways survivors can prepare themselves in the event they are confronted by ICE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a list of actions practitioners working with immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking can take now to help survivors who are at risk of an immigration enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Know Who is At Risk:&nbsp;</strong>The most recent enforcement action&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/ice-raids-targeting-migrant-families-slated-to-start-sunday-in-major-us-cities/2019/06/21/f2936318-942e-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html?utm_term=.edddb73d0752">had targeted families</a>&nbsp;and those with old deportation orders.&nbsp;Recent reports also indicate there may be “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/us/politics/ice-families-deport.html">collateral arrests”</a>. </p>



<p>
<strong>Share Know Your Rights Materials:</strong>&nbsp;Many advocacy groups have prepared materials to help immigrants know their rights in the event of an immigration enforcement action, these include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<a href="https://www.informedimmigrant.com/how-to-prepare-yourself-for-an-immigration-raid/">
<strong>Informed Immigrant</strong>
</a>
<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>This is a resource both for advocates and the general public on know your rights materials and preparedness planning (also available in<a href="https://www.inmigranteinformado.com/como-prepararse-para-una-redada-de-inmigracion/">&nbsp;Spanish/Español</a>)&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights">
<strong>ACLU</strong>
</a>
<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Comprehensive resources for immigrants on exercising their rights in different scenarios including when ICE is at a residence, or if stopped in transit.&nbsp; These materials are available in multiple languages&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.ilrc.org/prepare-your-community-assert-their-rights-against-possible-ice-arrests">
<strong>Immigrant Legal Resource Center:</strong>&nbsp;</a>ILRC has developed extensive know your rights materials as well as family preparedness plans in multiple languages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://cliniclegal.org/resources/know-your-rights-law-enforcement">
<strong>CLINIC</strong>:</a>&nbsp;CLINIC has created a<a href="https://cliniclegal.org/resources/rapid-response-toolkit"> rapid response toolkit a</a>s well as a guide entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://cliniclegal.org/resources/know-your-rights-law-enforcement">“Know Your Rights: A Guide to Your Rights When Interacting with Law Enforcement”</a>&nbsp;available in nine different languages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.org/resource-library/general-resources/">
<strong>ASISTA’s website</strong>
</a>&nbsp;for other resources</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Triage Individual Cases:&nbsp;</strong>If already working with survivors, advocates and attorneys should screen their cases for individuals with final orders of removal. Once identified, attorneys should consider drafting precautionary filings for these survivors, such as&nbsp;stays of removal&nbsp;and motions to reopen (for examples in the VAWA context&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sample-Motion-to-Reopen-and-Motion-for-Stay-of-Removal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here)</a>. &nbsp;This preparation will help ensure that, if your clients are picked up in an enforcement action, you are ready to file the paperwork necessary to stop their swift removals and argue for their release from detention.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Administration announced that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/trump-ice-raids.html"> they would delay the mass raids</a> scheduled for last week. Even though these actions have been briefly delayed, the announcement of these mass immigration enforcement actions created immense fear nationwide. For immigrant survivors of violence, this news exacerbates the trauma and fear they already endure because of the abuse they have experienced. Advocates can help address this fear by providing critical know your rights information and sharing ways to prepare themselves in the event they are confronted by ICE.  Below is a list of actions practitioners working with immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking can take now to help survivors who are at risk of an immigration enforcement action. </p>



<p>
<strong>Know Who is At Risk:&nbsp;</strong>The most recent enforcement action&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/ice-raids-targeting-migrant-families-slated-to-start-sunday-in-major-us-cities/2019/06/21/f2936318-942e-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html?utm_term=.edddb73d0752">had targeted families</a>&nbsp;and those with old deportation orders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Share Know Your Rights Materials:</strong>&nbsp;Many advocacy groups have prepared materials to help immigrants know their rights in the event of an immigration enforcement action, these include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<a href="https://www.informedimmigrant.com/how-to-prepare-yourself-for-an-immigration-raid/">
<strong>Informed Immigrant</strong>
</a>
<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>This is a resource both for advocates and the general public on know your rights materials and preparedness planning (also available in<a href="https://www.inmigranteinformado.com/como-prepararse-para-una-redada-de-inmigracion/">&nbsp;Spanish/Español</a>)&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights">
<strong>ACLU</strong>
</a>
<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Comprehensive resources for immigrants on exercising their rights in different scenarios including when ICE is at a residence, or if stopped in transit.&nbsp; These materials are available in multiple languages&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.ilrc.org/prepare-your-community-assert-their-rights-against-possible-ice-arrests">
<strong>Immigrant Legal Resource Center:</strong>&nbsp;</a>ILRC has developed extensive know your rights materials as well as family preparedness plans in multiple languages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://cliniclegal.org/resources/know-your-rights-law-enforcement">
<strong>CLINIC</strong>:</a>&nbsp;CLINIC has created a guide entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://cliniclegal.org/resources/know-your-rights-law-enforcement">“Know Your Rights: A Guide to Your Rights When Interacting with Law Enforcement”</a>&nbsp;available in nine different languages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.org/resource-library/general-resources/">
<strong>ASISTA’s website</strong>
</a>&nbsp;for other resources</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Triage Individual Cases:&nbsp;</strong>If already working with survivors, advocates and attorneys should screen their cases for individuals with final orders of removal. Once identified, attorneys should consider drafting precautionary filings for these survivors, such as&nbsp;stays of removal&nbsp;and motions to reopen (for examples in the VAWA context&nbsp;<a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sample-Motion-to-Reopen-and-Motion-for-Stay-of-Removal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here)</a>. &nbsp;This preparation will help ensure that, if your clients are picked up in an enforcement action, you are ready to file the paperwork necessary to stop their swift removals and argue for their release from detention.</p>

<p>To have the most impact, your comment submission should be <strong>in your own words and based upon your agency’s concerns and interests. </strong>Please individualize your comments with <strong>your own reasons and experiences</strong>, especially focusing on how the proposed fee waiver changes would <strong>burden survivors and your agency</strong>. In particular:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How will <strong>eliminating the means-tested benefit grounds</strong> for fee waiver harm the immigrant survivors and families with whom you work? How will this change harm your agency?</li>
<li>How will the new changes in the updated form <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0008-1251">instructions</a> and new I-912 <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0008-1253">form</a>, including requiring <strong>additional documentation to show household income</strong>, harm your clients and your agency? (For a table of changes, see <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0008-1250">here</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If giving examples, please take all appropriate measures to protect client confidentiality, including using a pseudonym, not listing specific locations, etc.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>On February 15, 2019 the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2019-0001-0001">published a proposed form</a>&nbsp;for notice and comment to collect information from the general public regarding purported immigration fraud. </p>



<p> At ASISTA, we are particularly concerned about this Fraud Tip form as it  represents another tool for abusers and perpetrators of crime to weaponize the immigration system against survivors, without consequence or repercussion. This is extremely problematic and dangerous, as abusers often use the threat of deportation as a tool to maintain power and control over survivors. </p>



<p>
<strong>We urge you&nbsp;and&nbsp;your organization to submit comments detailing your opposition to this proposed form.</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;The comment period closes Tuesday, April 16th.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>ASISTA, ILRC and the Arab American Institute have developed a <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/uscis_fraud_tip_form_fact_sheet_final-3.29.2019.pdf">comprehensive fact sheet</a> on the new USCIS Tip Form. In addition, you can use  this&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="template comment (opens in a new tab)" href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/uscis_tip_form_comment-1.docx" target="_blank">template comment</a> to speak out against this harmful form.&nbsp; We are grateful to ILRC, AAI, ACLU, AAPCHO, NIJC, CLINIC, and End Domestic Abuse WI&nbsp;for their contribution to these resources.</p>



<p>Using the template as a starting point, we suggest agencies<strong> individualize their comments with their own reasons and experiences why the proposed rule would harm immigrant survivors and their families so that they may be counted as a unique submission</strong>. In addition, to the extent possible, your comment submission should be in your own words and based upon your agency’s concerns and interests.  &nbsp;<strong>The goal is to maximize the number of unique comments to have the greatest impact.</strong>
</p>



<p> <strong>Deadline for submission is April 16, 2019. Comments can be submitted online at: </strong>
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2019-0001-0001">https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2019-0001-0001</a>
<strong> &nbsp;Please remember to review and clear any formatting before submission. &nbsp;</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>by Cecelia Friedman Levin,&nbsp;Senior&nbsp;Policy&nbsp;Counsel</em>
</p>



<p>I just returned from volunteering with the <a href="https://alotrolado.org/programs/border-rights-project/">Border Rights Project </a>at Al Otro Lado in Tijuana, Mexico. &nbsp;At the end of each day, volunteers often shared their “highs and lows” of what they experienced during the day. &nbsp;In that spirit, I share my own.  <br>
</p>



<p>Lows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The inhumane, unlawful and shameful treatment of asylum seekers. Our government is required to give all those seeking asylum at our border an opportunity to enter the United States and present their case. Never was there a requirement they wait en masse<em> </em>in another country, or<a href="https://latinousa.org/2019/03/15/stranded/"> keeping unaccompanied children&nbsp;in&nbsp;limbo</a>, or a requirement that asylum seekers are placed on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/americas/caravan-migrants-tijuana-mexico.html">an arbitrary and illegal list </a>and wait months<a href="https://supportkind.org/resources/remain-in-mexico-a-dangerous-and-untenable-proposal/"> living in unsafe conditions</a>. Whether or not the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trapped-tijuana-migrants-face-long-dangerous-wait-claim-asylum-n981721">U.S. government acknowledges it,</a> the list is very real, and the process of “metering” increases the dangers and risks asylum seekers face. &nbsp;(<em>For more on “La Lista”, listen to the prologue segment of This American Life from Sept. 2018 <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/656/let-me-count-the-ways">here</a>
</em>
<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/656/let-me-count-the-ways">)</a> </li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The fact that our government will make it as difficult and inhospitable as possible for asylum seekers to be able to present their case. I had to tell parents that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/migrant-family-separations-border.html"> they may be separated</a> from their children, that they and their children will only be able to have one layer of clothing on in the<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/what-are-las-hieleras-iceboxes-used-by-cbp-at-the-border.html"> hielera</a>. If asylum seekers are subject to the “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/trump-border-mexico-international-law-human-rights/">Remain in Mexico Program</a>” even after they PASS an interview on their credible fear, they may need to return to Mexico while their court case is pending. Let that sink in. Over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-admin-has-turned-back-240-asylum-seekers-border-under-n982246">240 asylum seekers</a> who established a credible fear must wait *in Mexico,* when they are filing for protection *in the United States* and their case is being heard *in the United States.* &nbsp;Not mention that DHS is <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-remain-in-mexico-hearings-20190314-story.html">completely botching this whole process</a> when applicants do show up for their hearings. &nbsp;I’m grateful to Al Otro Lado, Tahirih Justice Center, ACLU, Center for Gender and Refugee Studies and others<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/splc-aclu-trump-remain-in-mexico-lawsuit/"> who are challenging</a> this horrific and illegal policy.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Highs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The staff: Most of the on the ground staff are long-term volunteers who every day dedicate themselves to “radical acts of love.”  They provide a warm and genuine welcome to asylum seekers, food, a play space for children and legal information about the process. They are incredible.</li>
<li>My co-volunteers for the week were law students and their professors, NGO attorneys, undergrads, faith leaders, mental health professionals, and anyone and everyone in between. I’m grateful to and for their companionship and support during the week. </li>
<li>I played cards with a group of children while their parents were listening to a legal orientation. This actually fills me with mixed emotions. While I loved being with these kids, I pray they will have the safety and security that their parents so desperately want for them. </li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Now what? </strong>Please do something, anything, to support asylum seekers and those on the ground helping them EVERY. DAY. &nbsp;Here are my suggestions depending on your time and capacity. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Help:</strong> Look into other programs that assist asylum seekers in your area.  Have buckets of frequent flyer miles?<a href="https://www.miles4migrants.org/donate.php"> Donate them</a> to help reunite refugee families.

<li>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce a new publication entitled “<a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Apendix-Sample-Language-Fee-Waivers.pdf">Appendix: Sample Language for Submitting Initial Fee Waiver Requests or Contesting Denials</a>” Available in Word <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Appendix-Sample-Language-Fee-Waivers.docx">here</a>.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week ASISTA Immigration Assistance is privileged to join National Immigrant Justice Center, Human Rights First and over 150 organizations in submitting a comment in response to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security adoption of an interim final rule barring access to asylum for those who enter the United States outside ports of entry. &nbsp;You can read the comment </span>

</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">oppose the interim final rule as it is antithetical to preserving the rights and dignity of survivors of violence and their families. The interim rule is the latest attempt by the Administration to relentlessly and consistently curtail access to relief for those who have a legal right to protections. The interim rule is illegal and undermines our obligations to asylum seekers under the law.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We stand in solidarity with the organizations and individuals challenging this unconscionable policy in court and call on the Administration to immediately withdraw the rule and to dedicate agency efforts to creating policies that protect due process, the safety of survivors and &nbsp;maintains access to critical protections afforded under the law. </span>

<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:&nbsp;</strong>January 9, 2019</em>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<em>
<strong>Contact:&nbsp;</strong>Ahlam Moussa, ahlam@asistahelp.org</em>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">
<strong>ASISTA Response to President Trump’s National Address</strong>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>Suffield, CT –&nbsp;</strong>The following is a statement from Cecelia Friedman Levin, Senior Policy Counsel at ASISTA Immigration Assistance, regarding President Trump’s National Address:</p>
<p>President Trump’s remarks last night&nbsp;again demonstrate his misinformed, divisive, and anti-immigrant agenda and ignore the real crisis: the Administration has held the federal government hostage over a needless border wall and relentlessly failed to treat those seeking protection with the dignity and care they deserve.</p>
<p>There is no security emergency at the border. In fact, unauthorized border crossings along the Southwest border have dropped significantly to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wola.org/analysis/us-government-2018-border-data-trump-immigration-asylum-policy/">near their lowest point in half a century</a>. The only crisis is the one created by the Administration itself, resulting in significant harm and hardship to families and children seeking safety in the United States, many of them fleeing&nbsp;<a href="https://supportkind.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Neither-Security-nor-Justice_SGBV-Gang-Report-FINAL.pdf">sexual and gender-based violence</a>.</p>
<p>
<br style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adm</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">inist</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ration’s treatment of asylum-seekers has been inhumane and cruel. It has&nbsp;</span>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/26/trump-administration-family-separations-children-reunited">separated thousands of children from their caregivers</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">,&nbsp;</span>
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/trump-ending-central-american-minors-program/index.html">cut the Central American Minors program</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">that allowed individuals to apply for humanitarian relief while in their home countries, illegally&nbsp;</span>
<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/5/17428640/border-families-asylum-illegal">blocked individuals from requesting asylum</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;at the border, and</span>
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/13/676300525/almost-15-000-migrant-children-now-held-at-nearly-full-shelters">&nbsp;continues to warehouse thousands of children</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;in facilities ill-equipped to handle their care.&nbsp;</span>
<br style="font-weight: 400;">
<br style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his his remarks last night, the President said, “This is a choice between right and wrong. Justice and injustice.” It is decidedly clear that this Administration’s policies are on the wrong side.</span>

<table class="wp-block-table">

<tr>
<td>Yesterday, USCIS released <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2018/2018-06-28-PM-602-0050.1-Guidance-for-Referral-of-Cases-and-Issuance-of-NTA.pdf" target="_blank">Updated Guidance for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and Deportable Aliens</a> (Updated NTA memo) which vastly expands the circumstances in which USCIS will issue NTAs or refer cases to ICE.  This guidance implements the directive from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-border-security-immigration-enforcement-improvements/" target="_blank">January 2017 Executive Order </a>that individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected should be removed.<br>
<br>The updated NTA memo echoes the expanded enforcement priorities found in the executive orders; most notably, cases presenting a criminal history, fraud or misrepresentation or abuse of public benefits are high among the enforcement priorities.  The updated NTA memo also states that USCIS will issue an NTA if a case has been denied and the individual is not legally present in the United States.<br> <br>In cases involving VAWA, U and T visa applications, the Updated NTA memo states USCIS must follow the guidelines established in the memo once the case has been denied. It had been a <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DHS-QA-Session-November-2005.pdf " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long standing practice  (opens in a new tab)">long standing practice </a>that USCIS did not typically issue NTAs in connection with survivor-based filings like VAWA self-petitions, U and T visa applications. This was done in part due to the recognition of the chilling effect that this would have on victims coming forward to access these protections.  <br>
<br>Immigrant survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault often face barriers when seeking safety and protection, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/cop-molests-girl-deport-mother.html" target="_blank">threats from abusers and perpetrators</a> that reaching out for help will result in their deportation.  To address these barriers, Congress created essential protections in the Violence Against Women Act to provide survivors with protections against deportation to allow the to seek help without fear of abuser retaliation. The Updated NTA Memo flagrantly disregards and undermines the bi-partisan Congressional intent of establishing these critical safeguards for immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes.  <br> <br>In the upcoming days, ASISTA will be working on a practice advisory for those who serve VAWA, U and T visa applicants as well as co-hosting a call with our allies to discuss the implications of this memo. We are deeply disappointed by and concerned about this guidance. It will harm victims of crime, as the fear of the consequences of denial may prevent them from coming forward.<br> <br> <br>Sincerely,<br> <br>Cecelia Friedman Levin<br>Senior Policy Counsel<br>ASISTA</td>

The administration’s discussion of gender-based violence appears to be at the cost of propagating an anti-immigrant agenda, which we stridently reject.</p>
<p>In addition, Melissa Jeltsen at the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-violence-women-immigrants_us_5a5fc644e4b046f0811cc509">has written about this</a> referring to <a href="http://www.tahirih.org/news/tahirih-responds-to-incorrectly-cited-gender-based-violence-research-in-new-dhs-doj-report/">Tahirih’s statement</a> about how the Administration has mischaracterized the data that Tahirih has compiled in its work on forced marriage.</p>

If expelled from<br>
the United States, many of the 200,000 individuals now protected by Salvadoran TPS will face grave danger and high levels of violence, including gender-based violence. The National Taskforce calls on the Trump Administration to reconsider its decision to end TPS and urges Congress to enact a permanent legislative solution.  <a href="https://asistahelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/NTF-TPS-letter-final-1-9-18.pdf">NTF TPS letter final -1-9-18</a>

<p>Baez-Sanchez reiterates the 7th Circuits findings in <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2014/D03-12/C:13-1011:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:1306214:S:0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L.D.G. v. Holder, 744 F.3d 1022 (7th Cir. 2014),</a> where it found that the BIA and IJs had (d)(3) waiver authority as to U visas.  The BIA later disagreed in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/pages/attachments/2016/09/08/3870_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<em>Matter of Khan, 26 I&amp;N Dec. 797 (BIA 2016)</em>
</a>, doubting that (d)(3) waivers were meant for U visa applicants.  However, Baez holds the IJ has authority to decide (d)(3) waivers that came before them.  Baez-Sanchez and L.D.G. are crucial for noncitizen victims of crime in the Seventh Circuit who are facing removal from the United States.  Allowing IJs to decide on waiver applications ensures fair process, in-person proceedings, access to counsel, reasoned decision making, and the availability of appellate review.
