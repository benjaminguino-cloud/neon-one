<p class="has-text-align-center">– <em>2023 IRONMAN Foundation schedule consists of 18 service projects with a focus on DE&amp;I, military &amp; first responders, volunteerism, as well as health &amp; wellness</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (March 29, 2023) – The IRONMAN Foundation, Inc., which aims to create positive, tangible change in race communities through grants and volunteerism efforts, announced today its 2023 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team, along with 18 service project initiatives for the season. Leading the team as The IRONMAN Foundation Team Captain is IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Hall of Fame member, Mike Reilly.</p>



<p>“I am so glad that I joined The IRONMAN Foundation team seven years ago,” shared Mike Reilly, legendary IRONMAN race announcer and The IRONMAN Foundation 2023 Team Captain. “My only regret is I didn’t get involved sooner. During my time as The IRONMAN Foundation Team Captain, I’ve gotten to volunteer alongside hundreds of IRONMAN athletes and staff at The IRONMAN Foundation’s service projects and I’m excited for what is planned for this year.”</p>



<p>This year’s TEAM IMF Ambassadors are comprised of 20 carefully selected athletes ranging from beginners to seasoned racing veterans based on their outstanding involvement in IRONMAN event communities. Ambassadors exemplify what it means to ‘Race For More’ and are dedicated to creating positive change in the communities where IRONMAN athletes live, train, and race.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the ambassadors will focus their efforts on The IRONMAN Foundation’s TEAM IMF experience as well as supporting the 2023 IRONMAN Foundation service projects including Race For Change<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png"> relays and swim clinics, military care packages, hosting an adaptive surf clinic, and more.</p>



<p>“Our ambassadors not only have a passion for endurance sports, but they also realize the positive impact that sport can have on people and their communities,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “Through acts of service and commitment towards enhancing the experience for all athletes on race day and beyond, our ambassadors embrace the mission of The IRONMAN Foundation and our core values as an organization.”</p>

    <u>2023 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Athletes</u>
  </strong>
  <strong>
    <u>
  </u>
</strong>
</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation is excited to welcome all 20 ambassador athletes to the team. The below is a look at a few of this year’s team members.<strong>
<em>
</em>
</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>
<em>Sika Henry</em>
</strong> is the first U.S. Black female professional triathlete and a longtime advocate for The IRONMAN Foundation and the Race For Change<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png"> program. Last year, Henry partnered with The IRONMAN Foundation to build awareness, expand outreach, and work to identify and remove participation barriers within the sport of triathlon that impact Black and other diverse athlete groups.</li>



<li>
<strong>
<em>Sam Holness</em>
</strong>, or “Super Sam,” became the first known athlete with autism to complete the IRONMAN World Championship triathlon when he crossed the finish line in 2022 and for which he received recognition from the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/720980-first-person-with-autism-to-complete-an-ironman%C2%AE-140-6-triathlon">Guinness World Records</a>. Through his continued efforts to raise awareness for fellow athletes with autism and his motivation to help others with disabilities participate in triathlons, Sam has become a huge part of The IRONMAN Foundation’s mission. Sam will be racing with TEAM IMF at the 2023 VinFast IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship race in Lahti, Finland and at the 2023 Visit Panama City Beach IRONMAN Florida triathlon, part of the VinFast IRONMAN North America Series.</li>



<li>
<strong>
<em>Chris Nikic</em>
</strong> is the first person with Down syndrome to complete a full-distance IRONMAN triathlon and the first to cross the IRONMAN World Championship finish line at the 2022 VinFast IRONMAN World Championship for which he also has earned acclaim from <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2021/9/meet-chris-nikic-first-person-with-downs-syndrome-to-finish-ironman-676383">Guinness World Records</a>. Alongside Sam Holness, the two athletes continue to break down barriers in the sport and create new opportunities for athletes with disabilities, especially with The IRONMAN Group’s <a href="https://www.ironman.com/news_article/show/1258804">announcement</a> of the new Physically Challenged/Intellectual Disability (PC/ID) Open division.</li>



<li>
<strong>
  <em>Elizabeth Wood</em>
  </strong> has raced TEAM IMF for the last five years and has been an ambassador since 2020. After her husband passed away of a heart attack, triathlon was an outlet that gave her purpose again. Wood aims to raise awareness of how the mental toughness developed in triathlon not only gets you across the finish line, but also through challenging times in life. Now, Elizabeth is on a mission to help The IRONMAN Foundation increase female participation at all levels of triathlon and bring 30 women to compete at the 2023 VinFast IRONMAN World Championship race in Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i.</li>
</ul>



<p>

<p>IRONMAN has and continues to provide a welcoming platform and environment for all, becoming synonymous with monumental achievement by athletes from around the world, proving that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE<sup>®</sup>. Over IRONMAN’s 40-plus year history, the brand and its series of events have worked with and celebrated athletes of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds, from all races, religions, nationalities, and sexual orientations. Since the very first years, IRONMAN has represented breaking barriers and redefining what is possible. This legacy continues as athletes and the greater IRONMAN community have utilized the platform as a vehicle to challenge and redefine society views. The very first trailblazing Special Team of Dick and Rick Hoyt racing alongside other athletes was a pinnacle moment for what was to come. Their determination and fortitude has continued with athletes like John MacLean, Jim MacLaren, David Bailey, Carlos Moleda, Jim Howley, Scott Rigsby, Sarah Reinertsen, Rudy Tolson-Garcia, Ricky James, Turia Pitt, Minda Dentler, Team Agar, the Pease Brothers, Alex Zanardi, Rajesh Durbal, Team Liza, Lauren Parker, Roderick Sewell, and most recently Chris Nikic and Sam Holness, among so many others. These athletes and their achievements through IRONMAN have established non-profits and long-standing partnerships like the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which continues to do incredible work. The vastness of the athlete community, partners, and the openness that exists with its events is what makes IRONMAN special and is core to what the brand represents. Continuing the belief and importance of inclusivity, IRONMAN is committed to Women For Tri<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png"> and Race For Change<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png"> while working on additional avenues to further increase diversity, equity, and inclusion. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“As we reflect on our anniversary year, we are proud to recognize the immense and continued growth of The IRONMAN Foundation, which is a direct result of our supportive community, collaborative partners, and ambassadors,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are truly grateful for the community of volunteers and athletes that join us to empower and inspire the next generation of triathletes, runners, coaches, mentors, and change-makers. As we look back on our 20 years of service, we are honored to have added thousands of volunteers and athletes to The IRONMAN Foundation, bringing us one step closer towards our vision of a healthy, enriched, and fulfilled life for every person.”</p>



<p>Over the past 20 years, The IRONMAN Foundation adopted multiple community grant programs and launched new projects that have supported athletes, families, and communities in need. This includes the IRONMAN Foundation’s diversity initiative, <strong>
        <em>Race For Change<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png">
        </em>
      </strong>, which launched&nbsp;in 2020 with an initial pledge of $1 million to support programming that helps ensure equity for athletes in the sport of triathlon, and in the communities where IRONMAN&nbsp;athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train, and race.</p>



<p>In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation has developed programming for giveback organizations and grant opportunities within in the civil service, humanitarian aid, and health and wellness sectors with the goal of creating positive, tangible change in race communities.

                      </strong> and highlighting military and first responders through the Operation Gold Star program. Further, The IRONMAN Foundation is looking to take 30 women to race at the 2023 VinFast IRONMAN World Championship<sup>®</sup> triathlon in Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i, with the goal of strengthening the presence of women in the triathlon community.</p>

<em>– $20,000 worth of bicycles and toys to be delivered to 4KIDS Southwest Florida by Country Music artist Ryan Kinder and The IRONMAN Foundation staff</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
  <strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (Dec. 19, 2022) The IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Foundation, <a href="https://kennedylawracing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kennedy Law Racing</a>, and Kinder’s Kids have teamed up to provide children impacted by Hurricane Ian Christmas gifts this holiday. On Saturday, December 17, representatives from The IRONMAN Foundation and <a href="https://www.kinderskidsfoundation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinder’s Kids</a> delivered over $20,000 worth of bicycles and toys to 4KIDS Southwest Florida for children and families in the Ft. Meyers community devastated by Hurricane Ian in September.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The impact by Hurricane Ian is still being felt by businesses and families, months after the storm made landfall,” shared Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are very thankful for our friends from Kennedy Law Racing and Kinder’s Kids for teaming up with us to help bring some joy and comfort to children still recovering this holiday season by gifting them toys.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Included in the delivery to 4KIDS Southwest Florida were 30 bicycles built by members of The IRONMAN Foundation and The IRONMAN Group staff. Supported by a grant from Kennedy Law Racing, staff members spent the afternoon, Thursday, December 15, putting together the 30 bicycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tom Kennedy and Kennedy Law Racing through their partnership with The IRONMAN Foundation are honored to be donating $10,000 towards bicycles and toys to Southwest Florida 4Kids to aid in providing a Happy Holiday to children in the struggling Fort Myers area following the devastation from Hurricane Ian. Helping the community is a huge facet of Tom and the team and we are grateful for the opportunity to be an integral part of this great opportunity to assist,” said Park Alsop, Director of Kennedy Law Racing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the bicycles, 4KIDS Southwest Florida received a variety of toys collected by The IRONMAN Foundation and Kinder’s Kids. Founded by country music artist, Ryan Kinder and his wife, Mrs. Tennessee America 2019, Heather Kinder, Kinder’s Kids is a Nashville, Tennessee based organization focused on giving children affected by natural disasters a Christmas to remember. Ryan Kinder also serves as a member of The IRONMAN Foundation’s Ambassador Team, and recently completed the 2022 VinFast IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i in support of The IRONMAN Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Having the opportunity to bring a community in need some help is a wonderful thing. Even more so when it is in conjunction with the incredible people at The IRONMAN Foundation. Seeing the families and kids’ faces when we drop off the toys is an indescribable experience. To bring just a little solace amidst such a painful time is exactly why we do what we do,” shared Ryan and Heather Kinder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When we received a call regarding The IRONMAN Foundation and Kinder‘s Kids Foundation wanting to provide thousands of dollars worth of toys and bicycles to Southwest Florida, we were incredibly excited! We are so grateful for these two foundations and their efforts to collect these items and deliver them to our 4KIDS office in Southwest Florida. I know that there will be so many families that have great need, having lost so much in the storm, that will be incredibly blessed. We’ve got a busy week ahead of us as we will work to get these out before Christmas, but what a great way to spend these last few days before the holiday!” said Rick Jacobs, Executive Director for 4KIDS SWFL.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
  <strong>KAILUA-KONA, Hawai`i </strong>(October 5, 2022) – In celebration of the 2022 VinFast IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> World Championship event, The IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Foundation is continuing its commitment to leave a positive impact on the Island of Hawai`i long after race day, distributing $275,000 in charitable giveback to nonprofit initiatives and groups in the Kailua-Kona community.</p>



<p>While the IRONMAN World Championship last took place in Kailua-Kona in 2019, IRONMAN and the IRONMAN Foundation have remained steadfast in supporting the local community during the challenging past three years. Charitable programs included The IRONMAN Foundation’s Kahiau Together Aid Station food-distribution events, IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund Grants that served over 132,000 meals in addition to another $30,000 in grants to non-profits feeding their communities, Operation IRONAID Face Masks non-sterile face mask distribution and grant funding given to the Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation. Since 2003, the total giveback awarded to local Island of Hawai`i community charity organizations have equated to nearly $3 million.</p>



<p>“The Kailua-Kona community is an important part of IRONMAN and The IRONMAN Foundation, and even when it was not possible to host the IRONMAN World Championship, it was important for us to remember our Hawaiian roots and our employees in this community to take care of those who needed support the most in such a dire time,” shared Shane Facteau, COO of The IRONMAN Group and President of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are so grateful to be physically back with our `ohana here in Kailua-Kona as we work together to support the many important non-profits and initiatives on the Island of Hawai`i.”</p>



<p>“We are truly honored to partner with these organizations to provide funding and support for their initiatives,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together, as `Ohana, we’re leaving a positive and lasting impact here on the Island of Hawai`i.”</p>



<p>For more information on The IRONMAN Foundation’s giveback to the Island of Hawai’i and race week, activities see below:</p>



<p>
    <strong>
      <u>Kahiau Together</u>
    </strong>
  </p>



<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/KT-4-1024x592.jpg">


<p>The impact on the Island of Hawai’i during the COVID-19 pandemic became clear as hotels closed, restaurants and shops were shuttered, and the very volunteers who help make the iconic IRONMAN World Championship happen became some of the hardest hit. Together, with the local IRONMAN Hawai’i team, The IRONMAN Foundation created Kahiau Together.</p>



<p>Built from the Hawaiian word Kahiau, meaning to give generously and lavishly from the heart while not expecting anything in return, Kahiau Together consisted of 25 food distribution drive-through events throughout 2020 and 2021. As part of a $1 Million commitment to the community, The IRONMAN Foundation supported local fishermen, farmers, and ranchers by purchasing their products and then distributing these items in food bundles, providing over 132,000 meals to local community members.</p>



<p>
  <strong>
    <u>Support of the Kona Community Aquatic Center</u>
  </strong>
</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will provide $100,000 in grant funding to the Kona Aquatic Center for a new scoreboard at the facility. The scoreboard will allow the Kona Aquatic Center to host championship-level competitions at the facility, helping to then decrease the cost for families and athletes.</p>

<p>Additionally, The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with HOKA and Tom Kennedy of Kennedy Law Racing, will provide a $10,000 grant to the Hawai’i Aquatics Academy which provides free swim lessons during the school day to children. The Hawai’i Aquatics Academy’s swim lessons count as children’s Physical Education credit for many schools in Kona whose classes have been removed from the schools due to budget cuts. The children are bussed to the pool and taught water safety swim skills so that, in case of a water emergency, they can rescue themselves and get to safety.</p>

<p>A check presentation will take place following The IRONMAN Foundation and HOKA<sup>®</sup> Youth Swim Clinic on Sunday, October 9 at the Kona Community Aquatic Center from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Select IRONMAN Foundation Athletes, including the USA’s first Black female professional triathlete, Sika Henry, will work with local youth to establish basic comprehension of swimming and foster confidence in their level of swimming ability.</p>

<strong>
  <u>Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation / Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant</u>
</strong>
</a>
</p>



<p>This year The IRONMAN Foundation is recognizing local charity Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation as an outstanding and leading charitable organization and as such, will be awarded the Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant as part of $40,000 provided by the IRONMAN Foundation. The Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation is a volunteer-run, non-profit organization dedicated to providing essential equipment and training to the Hawai`i Island Fire Department which serves the Hawaii community. The Sayre family’s relationship with IRONMAN began in 1981 when Dr. Frank Sayre joined as the original Timing Director for the IRONMAN World Championship. His wife Laura Mallery-Sayre joined in 1983 and together they were directors of timing for 22 years. In 1997 after losing their 25-year-old son Daniel in a hiking accident, they established the Memorial Foundation. Since the inception of the Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation, IRONMAN and the IRONMAN Foundation have provided over $250,000 to continue to support the purchase of search and rescue training and equipment, including a brushfire truck, swiftwater training and equipment that helped to save countless lives during mass flooding in Hilo, a chopper spotter for Rescue Helicopter, underwater to surface rescue diving communication systems which has been instrumental in saving divers as well as rescue personnel, long-range communication systems for two lifeguard towers, rescue boards for the lifeguards, a Holmatro Jaws of Life, rescue ropes and training, EMS Heart Compressors for ambulances, and with the most recent funds, two Matric 30T Heat-seeking Rescue Drones that will assist firefighters in avoiding underground fire pits and also locate missing persons.</p>



<p>“Dave Orlowski was a long-time friend that we hosted in our home and looked forward to seeing every year at the IRONMAN World Championship,” said Laura Mallery-Sayre. “To receive this prestigious grant in his memory is so incredibly meaningful to us as he embodied the heart and soul of the IRONMAN family. We are most grateful for this honor and for the continued support from IRONMAN for our first responders that are serving our Island home.”</p>



<p>Dave Orlowski was a pioneer in the sport of triathlon as one of the original IRONMAN finishers in the inaugural event in 1978 and a member of The IRONMAN Foundation Board of Directors. In 2020, Orlowski passed away after battling leukemia. After his passing, The IRONMAN Foundation established the Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant, which is given out annually to honor Orlowski’s legacy of service through sport and commitment to community. The IRONMAN Foundation and Kennedy Law will host a Memorial for Dave Orlowski on Friday, October 7 from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. at the Kona Beach Hotel Formal Gardens. The event is open to the public.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<u>We’ve Got Your Back(Pack)</u>

<em>— Black Kids Swim, Black Runners Connection, and Major Taylor Cycling Club join the IRONMAN Foundation’s diversity and inclusion efforts —</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (March ##, 2022) – The IRONMAN Foundation today announced partnerships with Black Kids Swim<em>
<sup>®</sup>
</em>, Black Runners Connection, and Major Taylor Cycling Club to build awareness and expand outreach in support of its <strong>
<em>Race</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em> For Change</em>
</strong>
<em>
  <sup>TM</sup>
  </em> diversity initiative. The IRONMAN Foundation and the three affinity sports clubs will implement programming to address potential participation barriers that might prevent Black and other diverse athlete groups from competing in triathlons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, with the mission to ensure equity for athletes in the sport of triathlon and the communities where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train, and race, <em>Race For Change</em> was launched by The IRONMAN Foundation and The IRONMAN Group with an initial pledge of $1 million to support programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To kick off the collaboration, individuals affiliated from Black Kids Swim, Black Runners Connection, and Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance will form Race For Change relay teams to compete in several 2022 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> events throughout the United States. The goal behind the Race For Change relay teams is to foster support for The IRONMAN Foundation’s diversity initiative and inspire more diverse athletes to consider IRONMAN events. The <strong>
  <em>Race For Change</em>
  </strong> relay teams will take part in the following races:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>May 22: <strong>Sunbelt Bakery IRONMAN 70.3 North American Championship Chattanooga presented by McKee A Family Bakery</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>June 26: <strong>Maytag IRONMAN 70.3 Steelhead&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>October 1: <strong>St. Jude IRONMAN 70.3 Memphis &amp; IRONKIDS</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>
  <em>*Schedule subject to change</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be teaming up with Black Kids Swim, Black Runners Connection, and Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance through our <em>Race For Change </em>diversity<em> </em>initiative. We consider these groundbreaking partnerships an important collaboration as we seek to remove participation barriers to welcome more people into our sport,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black Kids Swim<em> </em>is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing Black participation in competitive swimming. It encourages Black families to take advantage of the academic, professional, and personal opportunities available through proficient swim skills. Black Kids Swim wants to see Black children do more than ‘survive’ in the water. The organization helps Black children develop valuable techniques, sportsmanship, and discipline that can benefit them physically and professionally their entire lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is an immense amount of untapped talent in the Black swimming community that needs assistance and recognition,” said Black Kids Swim Founder and Executive Director Ebony Rosemond. “Black Kids Swim recognizes triathlon is growing in popularity and will soon become an NCAA sport. We view this exciting partnership with IRONMAN Foundation’s <strong>
    <em>Race For Change</em>
    </strong> initiative as something that will increase Black participation in both competitive swimming and triathlons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black Runners Connection is a group that encourages Black people to embrace distance running throughout the world. It has more than 8,500 members nationwide and promotes the idea of a healthy mind and body as an athlete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Running is one of the most popular sports, and it is celebrated by being part of the largest endurance sport in the world,” said James Ravenell, president, and CEO of Black Runners Connection. “Being asked to be a part of IRONMAN Foundation’s <strong>
    <em>Race For Change</em>
    </strong> initiative will showcase how Black runners can participate in triathlons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance was named for Marshall “Major” Taylor, who in 1899 became the first Black American world champion in cycling. Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance is an all-inclusive cycling organization that looks to promote good health by supporting recreational and cycling activities in the community. It has clubs throughout the United States and overseas in Canada and Nairobi, Kenya.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the goals of Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance is to show how inclusive cycling is and how it’s for all communities,” said Bill Gaston, president of Major Taylor International Cycling Alliance. “We are excited and proud that the IRONMAN Foundation’s <strong>
    <em>Race For Change</em>
    </strong> initiative has invited our club to help with its diversity and inclusion efforts. Removing barriers and creating awareness of the multisport world is our goal. This is yet another avenue in the cycling community to be explored.”&nbsp;</p>

      </p>



<p>IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> has and continues to provide a welcoming platform and environment for all, becoming synonymous with monumental achievement by athletes from around the world, proving that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE<sup>®</sup>. Over IRONMAN’s 40-plus year history, the brand and its series of events have worked with and celebrated athletes of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds, from all races, religions, nationalities, and sexual orientations. Since the very first years, IRONMAN has represented breaking barriers and redefining what is possible. This legacy continues as athletes and the greater IRONMAN community have utilized the platform as a vehicle to challenge and redefine society views. The very first trailblazing Special Team of Dick and Rick Hoyt racing alongside other athletes was a pinnacle moment for what was to come. Their determination and fortitude has continued with athletes like John MacLean, Jim MacLaren, David Bailey, Carlos Moleda, Jim Howley, Scott Rigsby, Sarah Reinertsen, Rudy Tolson-Garcia, Ricky James, Turia Pitt, Minda Dentler, Team Agar, the Pease Brothers, Alex Zanardi, Rajesh Durbal, Team Liza, Lauren Parker, Roderick Sewell, and most recently Chris Nikic and Sam Holness, among so many others. These athletes and their achievements through IRONMAN have established non-profits and long-standing partnerships like the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which continues to do incredible work. The vastness of the athlete community, partners, and the openness that exists with its events is what makes IRONMAN special and is core to what the brand represents. Continuing the belief and importance of inclusivity, IRONMAN is committed to Women For Tri and Race For Change while working on additional avenues to further increase diversity, equity, and inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<em>— Race For Change External Advisory Council announced —&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (February 24, 2022) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> today announced a partnership with Sika Henry, the USA’s first Black female professional triathlete, and HOKA to build awareness and expand outreach in support of the <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong>
<em>
<sup>®</sup>
</em> initiative. In partnership with HOKA, the IRONMAN Foundation, and Henry will work to identify and remove participation barriers within the sport of triathlon that impact Black and other diverse athlete groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Henry will serve as an ambassador for <em>Race For Change</em> and work with the IRONMAN Foundation to develop community outreach engagements in conjunction with various 2022 <em>Race For Change</em> events associated with IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> and IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup> races, including: Certified Piedmontese Beef IRONMAN Tulsa triathlon, Maytag IRONMAN 70.3 Steelhead triathlon, St. Jude IRONMAN 70.3 Memphis triathlon, and Sunbelt Bakery IRONMAN 70.3 Chattanooga Presented by McKee A Family Bakery triathlon. In addition, she will take part in a social media campaign aimed at connecting with young athletes and those aspiring to compete in IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 races. Additional details surrounding the 2022 <em>Race For Change</em> events will be announced at a later date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am very happy to support the IRONMAN Foundation’s <em>Race For Change</em> initiative. I hope to extend and welcome more diverse athletes to our sport who have previously encountered barriers that prevented them from participating,” said <a href="https://www.sikahenry.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry</a>. “Throughout my journey to become a professional triathlete, I’ve worked hard to be someone others can look up to and who does something with my story. I am deeply passionate about making the sport more accessible, and I hope my story can inspire others to develop the skills necessary to complete any distance. Together, with the IRONMAN Foundation we can bring more people to the sport that I love so much.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, with the mission to ensure equity for athletes in the sport of triathlon and the communities where IRONMAN athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train and race, <em>Race For Change</em> was launched by the IRONMAN Foundation and The IRONMAN Group<sup>®</sup> with an initial pledge of $1 million to support programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Through <em>Race For Change</em>, we are teaming up with diverse communities to collaborate on how to best remove participation barriers from our sport at the grassroots level in order to recognize, empower, and sustain diverse competitor involvement long term,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “As a part of IRONMAN, the largest and most prestigious triathlon race series in the world, we must lead diversity advocacy efforts to welcome more diverse people into the sport as we collectively empower the next generation of great competitors, coaches, and history-makers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the goal of leading diversification and growth of the sport, the IRONMAN Foundation has also assembled a<strong> </strong>
<em>Race For Change</em> external advisory council consisting of industry professionals. The members of the external advisory council include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <strong>SACRAMENTO, Calif./TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (October 18, 2021) – In conjunction with the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> California triathlon, the IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will continue its mission of creating tangible impact in IRONMAN race communities throughout Northern California next week, by distributing over $35,000 in grants to nonprofit initiatives within the region. In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation will host an IRONAID<sup>®</sup> Food Drive and book signing with The Voice of IRONMAN, Mike Reilly, in IRONMAN Village to further benefit the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community,” said Audra Tassone-Indeck, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “Through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners, we hope to be able to make a difference in Northern California’s continued recovery from the many wildfires that have impacted so many.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will host an IRONAID Food Drive in IRONMAN Village at Capitol Mall and 9<sup>th</sup> Street Thursday, October 21 through Saturday, October 23. Athletes and guests are asked to drop non-perishable food items.&nbsp; All items collected will go to the Central Downtown Food Basket which feeds more than 1,500 food insecure households a month at mobile sites throughout Sacramento, California.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation will host two book signings with The Voice of IRONMAN, IRONMAN Foundation Team Captain, and author, Mike Reilly in IRONMAN Village on Friday, October 22 from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM and Saturday, October 23 from 12 PM to 1 PM. Donations to the IRONMAN Foundation’s Humanitarian Relief Fund will be accepted to assist with Northern California Wildfire rebuilding efforts.&nbsp; Attendees may purchase a book on-site or bring their own for Reilly to sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have been involved with the IRONMAN Foundation for many years and I am so proud of the support the organization continues to provide to our IRONMAN race communities,” shared Mike Reilly, Voice of IRONMAN. “I’m especially proud of the organization’s Humanitarian Relief efforts here in my home state of California. I am very excited to meet our athletes and supporters at the IRONMAN Foundation booth in IRONMAN Village and do my part to help raise funds to help Northern California rebuild.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One Humanitarian Relief Grant recipient is the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County’s Fire Response Fund which will receive $10,000 to further its wildfire rebuilding and recovery efforts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and North Coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN and IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> events are held. In 2021 the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $2 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to $450,000 throughout Northern California IRONMAN, IRONMAN 70.3, and Rock ‘n’ Roll<sup>®</sup> Running Series events.  &nbsp;</p>

<em>– Race For Change efforts aimed to increase Black triathletes as well as other diverse groups nationwide</em>
</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>MEMPHIS, Tenn. / TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (September 27, 2021) – Through its <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
  <sup>TM</sup>
  </em>
</strong> initiative, The IRONMAN<sup> </sup>Group and IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> is teaming up with local communities and organizations to address potential barriers to entry that could prevent Black and other diverse groups from participating in triathlons. Coinciding with the 2021 St. Jude IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Memphis triathlon, <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong> will be championing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at a special event on Sunday, October 3, in partnership with the YMCA of Greater Memphis and Major Taylor Memphis Cycling Club.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the largest organizer of endurance events globally, inclusive of some of the most prestigious races in the world, The IRONMAN Group is working as leaders of our industry by advocating diversity efforts that aim to proactively remove participation barriers in order to welcome more people of color into our sport,” said Shane Facteau, COO of The IRONMAN Group and President of the IRONMAN Foundation. “Our vision of success for the <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong> initiative is to attract and welcome people from all backgrounds to our sport and IRONMAN community so that they too can enjoy the life-changing event experiences that our teams work so hard to create.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate Memphis’s rich and diverse music scene, the IRONMAN Foundation has partnered with Stax Music Academy’s Songwriting Cohort to produce a theme song for the <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong> in connection with the local Memphis initiative and St. Jude IRONMAN 70.3 Memphis triathlon. The Stax Music Academy’s Songwriting Cohort was formed in 2019 when Justin Timberlake and Levi’s Music Project installed a permanent Songwriting Lab in the academy and provided funding for a songwriting and music business instructor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are treating this like a professional songwriting competition,” said Pat Mitchell Worley, Stax Music Academy Executive Director. “The students are learning how to write jingles and the ability to engage with IRONMAN to create a theme song for this initiative will help the students with their craft in the future.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The winning Stax Music Academy group is comprised of Ashton Mack (Memphis Virtual School), Noah Israel (Gateway Christian Academy), Nadia Hopkins (Hamilton High School), and Violette Worley (Crosstown High School). They will perform their original theme song prior to the race start at the St. Jude IRONMAN 70.3 Memphis triathlon event on Saturday, October 2. The group will also perform the song at the IRONMAN Foundation’s <strong>
<em>Race For Change</em>
</strong>
<strong>
  <em>
    <sup> </sup>
    </em>
  </strong>community event on Sunday, Oct 3<sup> </sup>at Douglass Park and Community Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sunday event will also feature giveaways and donations to the Memphis area YMCA and Major Taylor Memphis Cycling Club, introducing triathlon to the next generation of diverse IRONMAN participants. The partnership with the YMCA of Greater Memphis will offer free swimming lessons and swim safety curriculum for children attending local elementary schools throughout the city with a focus on predominately Black communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In collaboration with the Major Taylor Memphis Cycling Club, kids bikes and helmets, as well as bike safety training sessions, will be given to Memphis-area children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speakers during the event will include representatives from The IRONMAN Group, IRONMAN Foundation and the Memphis community who will talk about achieving one’s full potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <strong>
  <em>Race For Change</em>
  </strong> campaign was launched in 2020 with an initial pledge of $1 million to support programming that will help ensure equity for athletes in the sport of triathlon, and in the communities where IRONMAN athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train, and race. Through <strong>
  <em>Race For Change</em>
  </strong>, The IRONMAN Group and IRONMAN Foundation are working to recognize, empower, and sustain the next generation of great triathlon competitors, coaches and history-makers. For more information about <strong>

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">About IRONMAN DE&amp;I Efforts</span>
    </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> has and continues to provide a welcoming platform and environment for all, becoming synonymous with monumental achievement by athletes from around the world proving that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE<sup>®</sup>. Over IRONMAN’s 40-plus year history, the brand and its series of events have worked with and celebrated athletes of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds, from all races, religions, nationalities, and sexual orientations. Since the very first years, IRONMAN has represented breaking barriers and redefining what is possible. This legacy continues as athletes and the greater IRONMAN community have utilized the platform as a vehicle to challenge and redefine society views. The very first trailblazing Special Team of Dick and Rick Hoyt racing alongside other athletes was a pinnacle moment for what was to come. Their determination and fortitude has continued with athletes like John MacLean, Jim MacLaren, David Bailey, Carlos Moleda, Jim Howley, Scott Rigsby, Sarah Reinertsen, Rudy Tolson-Garcia, Ricky James, Turia Pitt, Minda Dentler, Team Agar, the Pease Brothers, Alex Zanardi, Rajesh Durbal, Team Liza, Lauren Parker, Roderick Sewell, and most recently Chris Nikic and Sam Holness, among so many others. These athletes and their achievements through IRONMAN have established non-profits and long-standing partnerships like the Challenged Athletes Foundation that continue to do incredible work. The vastness of the athlete community, partners and the openness that exists with its events is what makes IRONMAN special and is core to the what the brand represents. Continuing the belief and importance of inclusivity, IRONMAN is committed to Women For Tri and Race For Change while working on additional avenues to further increase diversity, equity and inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five athletes will race the 2021 Intermountain Healthcare IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> World Championship presented by Utah Sports Commission in support of the IRONMAN Foundation and its programs, including Carlos Omar who is aiming to set a Guinness World Record.

Along his journey to reach the record, Omar is raising awareness and funds for the IRONMAN Foundation, with the money he raises going back to his hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as the other race communities where he is racing on this journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                      </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006 the inaugural IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> World Championship was held in Clearwater, Florida becoming another test for the world’s elite triathletes. Since that auspicious beginning, the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship has grown in stature and popularity moving first to Henderson, Nevada in 2011, where athletes encountered a more challenging terrain and then to Mont-Tremblant, Quebec—its first stop on the new “global rotation” for the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship. The event reached European soil for the first time ever in 2015, with Zell am See, Austria, hosting an epic and memorable event. In 2016, the race moved from the mountains to the beaches of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. In 2017, the race returned to the United States, taking place in Chattanooga, Tennessee where it became a two-day event for the first time. In 2018, the event reached the African continent for the first time and was hosted in Nelson Mandela Bay in South Africa. Continuing the rotation, 2019 saw the French Riviera and Nice, France play host to the ever-growing IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship event. More than 200,000 athletes participate annually in a series of qualifying races, consisting of over 100 events in locations such as Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, North America, South Africa and Switzerland. Hosting more than 5,000 athletes from around the world, participants in the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship have ranged in age from 18 to 85-plus. In 2021, the event takes place in the Red Rocks of St. George, Utah on September 18 in the United States and again on October 28-29, 2022, before shifting to Lahti, Finland on August 26-27, 2023.

<p class="has-text-align-center">
              <em>– Race for Change efforts aimed to increase Black triathletes as well as other diverse groups nationwide</em>
              </p>



<p>
              <strong>TAMPA, Fla.&nbsp;</strong>(May 13, 2021) – Through its&nbsp;<strong>
                <em>Race for Change<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>
                </em>
              </strong>initiative, the IRONMAN Foundation and The IRONMAN Group will be teaming up with local communities and organizations to address potential barriers to entry that could prevent Black and other diverse groups from participating in triathlons. Kicking things off at the Certified Piedmontese IRONMAN<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>North American Championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Race for Change initiative will activate grassroots diversity outreach campaigns in select cities where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>, IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>70.3<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>and Rock ‘n’ Roll<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>Running series events are held throughout the United States. Through Race for Change, The IRONMAN Group and IRONMAN Foundation are working to recognize, empower, and sustain the next generation of great triathlon competitors, coaches, and history-makers.</p>



<p>“As the largest and most prestigious endurance event organizer in the world, The IRONMAN Group will lead our industry by championing diversity advocacy efforts that proactively remove participation barriers in order to welcome more people of color into our sport,” said Shane Facteau, COO of The IRONMAN Group and President of The IRONMAN Foundation. “Our vision of success for the&nbsp;<strong>
              <em>Race for Change&nbsp;</em>
              </strong>initiative is to attract and welcome people from all backgrounds to our sport and IRONMAN community while continuing to create life-changing event experiences worldwide.”</p>



<p>Coinciding with the Certified Piedmontese IRONMAN<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>Tulsa triathlon race week (race day being Sunday, May 23) and to begin its campaign of addressing these access hurdles across North America,&nbsp;<strong>
              <em>Race for Change&nbsp;</em>
              </strong>will be championing diversity, equity &amp; inclusion efforts at a special event on Friday, May 21 in Tulsa, Oklahoma in partnership with the YMCA of Greater Tulsa and The Salvation Army Boys &amp; Girls Club of Metro Tulsa.</p>



<p>The Friday, May 21 event will feature giveaways and donations to the Tulsa area YMCA and the local Boys &amp; Girls Club, introducing triathlon to the next generation of diverse IRONMAN participants. The partnership with the YMCA of Greater Tulsa will offer free swimming lessons and swim safety curriculum for children attending the local elementary school near the Greenwood District.</p>



<p>
              <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Partnerships with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Metro Tulsa will allow giveaways of bikes and helmets as well as bike safety curriculum to children within the inner-city Tulsa community. Speakers during the event will include representatives from The IRONMAN Group, IRONMAN Foundation and from the Tulsa community as well as inspirational professional triathlete and coach Matt Russell who will talk about achieving one’s full potential.</p>



<p>The groups will also be participating in efforts to recognize the centennial anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre which took place between May 31 and June 1 in 1921.</p>



<p>To preserve and inspire achievements while restoring community culture lost, a mural has been commissioned through the&nbsp;<strong>
                <em>Race for Change&nbsp;</em>
                </strong>initiative, showing future generations that “Anything Is Possible<sup>®</sup>”. The painting of the mural will be created by sisters Elizabeth and Christina Henley along with fellow artist, Melody Allen. All are from Tulsa’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackmoontulsa.com/">Black Moon Collective</a>. The Collective, composed of local black artists, will use a wall in the W.L. Hutcherson branch of the YMCA as their canvas.</p>



<p>In addition, the first one-hundred-yards of the 2021 Certified Piedmontese IRONMAN<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>Tulsa run course, will be adorned with inspirational messages that acknowledges the past and points to a brighter future together. This stretch of the run course takes place in the historic location of Black Wall Street, the heart of where the Tulsa Race Massacre took place in 1921.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>
                <em>Race for Change&nbsp;</em>
                </strong>campaign was launched&nbsp;in 2020 with an initial pledge of $1 million to support programming that will help ensure equity for athletes in the sport of triathlon, and in the communities where IRONMAN&nbsp;athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train and race.

<p class="has-text-align-center">–<em> Company seeks to unlock the full potential of its sports by furthering the sense of belonging</em>
</p>



<p>The words Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) are not just buzz words or trends, but an intrinsic part of the work and community cultures that The IRONMAN Group is looking to further foster. The organization understands that in order to achieve their goals, it is of utmost importance to attract and welcome the world’s most talented people and athletes from all backgrounds while continuing to create life changing event experiences globally.</p>



<p>Acknowledging the need to bring in outside expertise in this area, The IRONMAN Group is proud to announce it has retained the nation’s premier Diversity, Equity and Inclusion firm, Kaleidoscope Group, to lead their DE&amp;I transformation.</p>



<p>Fully endorsed by Andrew Messick, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer for The IRONMAN Group, the global sports event producer considers their DE&amp;I effort a business imperative for the entire organization. Every part of the company will be accountable for this transformation to ensure its health and sustained growth.</p>



<p>“Diversity in mass participation sports is something that has and continues to carry incredible importance to us and the overall industry, and while individuals of all backgrounds have been welcomed and celebrated during our 40-year history, it is important that we recognize opportunities to further develop,” said Messick.</p>



<p>As the largest mass participation sports event producer in the world, The IRONMAN Group is working to lead diversity advocacy efforts through a multi-tiered outreach campaign to address the lack of Black athlete diversity among race participants. In partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation, The IRONMAN Group launched <strong>
<em>Race for Change</em>
</strong> in 2020 with the mission to remove barriers to equity for its athletes, in the sport of triathlon, and in the communities where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train and race while doing the same with its internal workforce.</p>



<p>“Over the past several months, we have spent time reflecting, listening, learning, and discussing what role the company – and all of us collectively – must play in helping to drive change, both within The IRONMAN Group and in our race communities,” continued Messick. “With significant input from employees and leaders, we determined that the Kaleidoscope Group was the perfect partner to lead our transformation through Race For Change and internal DE&amp;I efforts.”</p>



<p>According to Messick, the Kaleidoscope Group partnership reflects The IRONMAN Group’s commitment to not only raise awareness of DE&amp;I issues that exist within the sport of triathlon, but to further create a sense of belonging for all communities of color.</p>



<p>It is the organization’s belief that it must empower the next generation of great competitors, coaches, and history-makers by proactively removing barriers to entry. Through its collaboration with Kaleidoscope Group, one of the initial goals for The IRONMAN Group will be to support local run and triathlon clubs and organizations focused on growing the number of Black athlete participation in the sport five-fold within the next five years. Growth of the Latinx community as well as growing female participation through the Women For Tri initiative is also critical focus areas.</p>



<p>The company also intends to elevate existing staff talent, build a work culture based on inclusion and work with local organizations to recruit diverse applicants.</p>



<p>According to Kaleidoscope Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Doug Harris, The IRONMAN Group is committed to making real progress toward a more inclusive culture and community for its race participants.</p>



<p>“Their mission to welcome more diverse athletes to the sport is being led by employees from all levels within the organization. That shows a true willingness which is needed to succeed,” said Harris.</p>



<p>The transformative outreach work required to drive change for The IRONMAN Group will be driven through the <strong>
<em>Race for Change</em>
</strong> campaign. To date, progress includes: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list" id="block-957b057d-e527-4708-bbcf-45df7eed7611">

      <u>About IRONMAN DE&amp;I Efforts</u>
    </strong>
    <br>IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> has and continues to provide a welcoming platform and environment for all, becoming synonymous with monumental achievement by athletes from around the world proving that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE<sup>®</sup>. Over IRONMAN’s 40-plus year history, the brand and its series of events have worked with and celebrated athletes of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds, from all races, religions, nationalities, and sexual orientations. Since the very first years, IRONMAN has represented breaking barriers and redefining what is possible. This legacy continues as athletes and the greater IRONMAN community have utilized the platform as a vehicle to challenge and redefine society views. The very first trailblazing Special Team of Dick and Rick Hoyt racing alongside other athletes was a pinnacle moment for what was to come. Their determination and fortitude has continued with athletes like John MacLean, Jim MacLaren, David Bailey, Carlos Moleda, Jim Howley, Scott Rigsby, Sarah Reinertsen, Rudy Tolson-Garcia, Ricky James, Turia Pitt, Minda Dentler, Team Agar, the Pease Brothers, Alex Zanardi, Rajesh Durbal, Team Liza, Roderick Sewell, and most recently Chris Nikic, among so many others. These athletes and their achievements through IRONMAN have established non-profits and long-standing partnerships like the Challenged Athletes Foundation that continue to do incredible work. The vastness of the athlete community, partners and the openness that exists with its events is what makes IRONMAN special and is core to the what the brand represents. Continuing the belief and importance of inclusivity, IRONMAN is committed to Women For Tri and Race For Change while working on additional avenues to further increase diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

  <em>Company seeks to unlock the full potential of its sport by furthering the sense of belonging</em>
  </p>



<p>
  <strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(April 21, 2021) – The words Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) are not just buzz words or trends, but an intrinsic part of the work and community cultures that The IRONMAN Group is looking to further foster. The organization understands that in order to achieve their goals, it is of utmost importance to attract and welcome the world’s most talented people and athletes from all backgrounds while continuing to create life changing event experiences globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acknowledging the need to bring in outside expertise in this area, The IRONMAN Group is proud to announce it has retained the nation’s premier Diversity, Equity and Inclusion firm, Kaleidoscope Group, to lead their DE&amp;I transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fully endorsed by Andrew Messick, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer for The IRONMAN Group, the global sports event producer considers their DE&amp;I effort a business imperative for the entire organization. Every part of the company will be accountable for this transformation to ensure its health and sustained growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Diversity in mass participation sports is something that has and continues to carry incredible importance to us and the overall industry, and while individuals of all backgrounds have been welcomed and celebrated during our 40-year history, it is important that we recognize opportunities to further develop,” said Messick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the largest mass participation sports event producer in the world, The IRONMAN Group is working to lead diversity advocacy efforts through a multi-tiered outreach campaign to address the lack of Black athlete diversity among race participants. In partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation, The IRONMAN Group launched <strong>
    <em>Race for Change</em>
    </strong> in 2020 with the mission to remove barriers to equity for its athletes, in the sport of triathlon, and in the communities where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> athletes and first-time hopefuls live, train and race while doing the same with its internal workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the past several months, we have spent time reflecting, listening, learning, and discussing what role the company – and all of us collectively – must play in helping to drive change, both within The IRONMAN Group and in our race communities,” continued Messick. “With significant input from employees and leaders, we determined that the Kaleidoscope Group was the perfect partner to lead our transformation through Race For Change and internal DE&amp;I efforts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Messick, the Kaleidoscope Group partnership reflects The IRONMAN Group’s commitment to not only raise awareness of DE&amp;I issues that exist within the sport of triathlon, but to further create a sense of belonging for all communities of color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the organization’s belief that it must empower the next generation of great competitors, coaches, and history-makers by proactively removing barriers to entry. Through its collaboration with Kaleidoscope Group, one of the initial goals for The IRONMAN Group will be to support local run and triathlon clubs and organizations focused on growing the number of Black athlete participation in the sport five-fold within the next five years. Growth of the Latinx community as well as growing female participation through the Women For Tri initiative is also critical focus areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also intends to elevate existing staff talent, build a work culture based on inclusion and work with local organizations to recruit diverse applicants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Kaleidoscope Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Doug Harris, The IRONMAN Group is committed to making real progress toward a more inclusive culture and community for its race participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Their mission to welcome more diverse athletes to the sport is being led by employees from all levels within the organization. That shows a true willingness which is needed to succeed,” said Harris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transformative outreach work required to drive change for The IRONMAN Group will be driven through the <strong>
    <em>Race for Change</em>
    </strong> campaign. To date, progress includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An initial pledge of $1 million to fund the <strong>
    <em>Race for Change</em>
    </strong> initiative.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Finalizing creation of an Advisory Council for the <strong>
    <em>Race for Change</em>
    </strong> program to help guide the organization’s actions to ensure resources are properly allocated to efforts that deliver the greatest impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Finalizing internal DE&amp;I Committee within the organization to provide a voice to the workforce, developing ways to become a more inclusive organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The company plans to continue taking meaningful and substantive actions in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant</strong>
  <br>In memory of Dave Orlowski, one of the original IRONMAN finishers from 1978 and IRONMAN Foundation Board of Directors member, the IRONMAN Foundation has launched the Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant to acknowledge one of the pioneers of the sport of triathlon. At the request of the Orlowski family, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital received the first Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant in the amount of $5,000 following Dave’s passing on Dec. 15, 2020. The annual grant will honor Dave’s legacy of service through sport and commitment to community by recognizing charitable organizations throughout IRONMAN and IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> race communities. The 2021 Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant will be distributed to an organization within in the Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i community, home of the IRONMAN World Championship<sup>® </sup>and a location near and dear to Dave. Grantees will be announced on a date near Dave’s birthdate of August 25 and will be selected by local Race Directors.</p>



<p>“The passing of one of IRONMAN’s beloved original heroes has been difficult for all of us in the triathlon `ohana,” said Shane Facteau, Board of Directors, President for the IRONMAN Foundation and Chief Operating Officer for The IRONMAN Group. “As a community, we will continue to chase for the standards that Dave Orlowski set for triathlon and will aim to carry on his courage, empathy, perseverance, and optimism within the communities that we serve.”</p>



<p>
    <strong>IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund</strong>
      <br>In 2020, the IRONMAN Foundation announced the expansion of its IRONAID program to specifically focus on serving event communities in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through its 2020 IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grant program, over $500,000 was distributed to 200 charitable organizations. The IRONMAN Foundation will continue its commitment to support IRONMAN, IRONMAN 70.3, and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series<sup>®</sup> host cities with the continuation of the IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grant program in to 2021 where it will support charitable organizations and COVID-19 response programs.</p>



<p>“As we continue to face the global challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely thankful to our partners who chose to continue on this journey with us in 2021 to provide support through grant funding, non-sterile face masks, and nutritional aid,” Facteau added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  <em>– Grant applications for the IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund now open for health-related organizations</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
    <strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(February 11, 2021) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> has kicked off its 2021 giving year with the announcement of the Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant and its 2021 IRONAID<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Support Fund programs, including Operation IRONAID Face Masks in partnership with Framebridge and Good360.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
      <strong>Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In memory of Dave Orlowski, one of the original IRONMAN finishers from 1978 and IRONMAN Foundation Board of Directors member, the IRONMAN Foundation has launched the Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant to acknowledge one of the pioneers of the sport of triathlon. At the request of the Orlowski family, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital received the first Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant in the amount of $5,000 following Dave’s passing on Dec. 15, 2020. The annual grant will honor Dave’s legacy of service through sport and commitment to community by recognizing charitable organizations throughout IRONMAN and IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> race communities. The 2021 Dave Orlowski Memorial Grant will be distributed to an organization within in the Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i community, home of the IRONMAN World Championship<sup>®</sup>
        <sup> </sup>and a location near and dear to Dave. Grantees will be announced on a date near Dave’s birthdate of August 25 and will be selected by local Race Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The passing of one of IRONMAN’s beloved original heroes has been difficult for all of us in the triathlon `ohana,” said Shane Facteau, Board of Directors, President for the IRONMAN Foundation and Chief Operating Officer for The IRONMAN Group. “As a community, we will continue to chase for the standards that Dave Orlowski set for triathlon and will aim to carry on his courage, empathy, perseverance, and optimism within the communities that we serve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
          <strong>IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, the IRONMAN Foundation announced the expansion of its IRONAID program to specifically focus on serving event communities in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through its 2020 IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grant program, over $500,000 was distributed to 200 charitable organizations. The IRONMAN Foundation will continue its commitment to support IRONMAN, IRONMAN 70.3, and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series<sup>®</sup> host cities with the continuation of the IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grant program in to 2021 where it will support charitable organizations and COVID-19 response programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we continue to face the global challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely thankful to our partners who chose to continue on this journey with us in 2021 to provide support through grant funding, non-sterile face masks, and nutritional aid,” Facteau added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2021 IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grant applications are now being accepted for the first round of grants from health-related organizations with COVID-19 response programs at <a href="http://www.ironmanfoundation.org/ironaid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.ironmanfoundation.org/ironaid</a>.

<p>
            <strong>Operation IRONAID Face Masks</strong>&nbsp;</p>

Together, these brands are repurposing new and unused shirts into non-sterile face masks.

      </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-red-background-color has-vivid-red-color is-style-wide">



<p>As the pandemic roared on in 2020, the impact on the Island of Hawai`i became clear as hotels closed, restaurants and shops were shuttered, and the very volunteers who help make the iconic IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> World Championship<sup>®</sup> happen became one of the hardest hit. Under the leadership of Diana Bertsch, Senior Vice President, World Championship Events for The IRONMAN Group, her local IRONMAN Hawai`i team was inspired to take action, creating Kahiau Together, an aid station and drive-through food distribution effort to feed as many members of the community as possible. The mission of the program is built from the Hawaiian word Kahiau, meaning to give generously or lavishly from the heart while not expecting anything in return.</p>



<p>In support of the IRONMAN Hawai`i team’s mission, the IRONMAN Foundation pledged $1 million to help feed the Island of Hawai`i community, home of the IRONMAN World Championship, through Kahiau Together’s local food distribution program. The Kahiau Together Aid Station drive-through events, which first began last July, continue to distribute over 600 food bundles of locally sourced fresh proteins, fruits, vegetables, and starches. To date, over 35,000 meals have been served through 14 distribution events.</p>



<p>“With the <a>devastating</a> impact the COVID-19 pandemic has caused around the globe and locally in Hawai`i, all of us at IRONMAN are reminded of the importance of taking care of our `ohana when times are tough,” said Diana Bertsch, Senior Vice President, World Championship Events for The IRONMAN Group. “The people of Hawai`i are resilient and we want our `ohana locally to know we are still here to support the community through Kahiau Together. With this program, we will be distributing food sourced from local producers every month, doing what is right, sharing with others. Not only is our community being fed, our local farmers, fishermen and ranchers are benefitting too. We will all endure the impacts of the pandemic together, as well as take a step back to reflect and be grateful for what we have, and how we are able to lift others up during challenging times.”</p>

<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/KT-2-1024x700.jpg">





<p>The IRONMAN team understands that collaboration and partnerships are key factors to achieving success. Mahea Akau, IRONMAN&nbsp;World Championship Event Manager, quickly took up the task of putting the Kahiau Together program together, forming a team of partners and resources.</p>



<p>One of the many local vendor partnerships include Pā’ina by Ocean, a farmer’s market-type platform designed to support the local culinary and agricultural communities. Pā’ina by Ocean was created by Ocean Kanekoa, a freshman at Honokaa High School, and his father Jayson Kanekoa, the Executive Chef at the Waikoloa Marriot. For over a year now, Pā’ina by Ocean has been bringing farmers and ranchers together to help distribute local food to communities in need.</p>



<p>“With partnerships like Kahiau Together, we are helping our island’s farmers, ranchers and fishermen. Our local hotels and restaurants used to buy locally, but when COVID-19 hit, our local producers had nowhere to turn,” said Ocean Kanekoa, founder of Pā’ina by Ocean. “Programs like IRONMAN Foundation’s Kahiau Together, well it helps everyone.”</p>



<p>For January’s Kahiau Together efforts, food boxes included ground beef from Double D Ranch in Laupahoehoe, Hawai`i, Hilo’s Tomori’s Tofu Factory, chicken thighs from Suisan Company, Big Island Flava sausage mix, Alii Mushrooms and an assortment of mixed greens and kale from Mother Nature’s Miracle Farm located on the Hamakua Coast.</p>



<p>“This was our first Kahiau Together distribution for 2021, and we are focused on Kumukahi, which means a new beginning,” said Mahea Akau, IRONMAN&nbsp;World Championship Event Manager. “I want our community to know we are here to support and help them.”</p>



<p>Kahiau Together not only distributes local food bundles, but also assists local nonprofit organizations with grants to help with critical funding to fill food banks, meet ongoing food insecurity needs, and provide long-term support for the Hawai’i Island community. Kahiau Together Grant applications are available to local nonprofit organizations to specifically support hunger relief on the Island of Hawai`i. Health and food supply related organizations with COVID-19 response programs are encouraged to apply to the grant funding by visiting <a href="https://secure.ironmanfoundation.org/np/clients/ironmanfoundation/customobjectdata.jsp?forwardedFromSecureDomain=1&amp;&amp;webFormId=32">here</a>.</p>



<p>The next Kahiau Together event will take place on February 15 from 10 a.m. to noon HST at Kona International Marketplace.</p>

  <strong>KAILUA-KONA, Hawai`i / TAMPA Fla. </strong>(February 4, 2021) – As the pandemic roared on in 2020, the impact on the Island of Hawai`i became clear as hotels closed, restaurants and shops were shuttered, and the very volunteers who help make the iconic IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> World Championship<sup>®</sup> happen became one of the hardest hit.

      <strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(October 20, 2020) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> has announced the fourth distribution of its IRONAID<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Support Fund grants to 40 charitable organizations. To date, over $400,000 has been distributed to 160 health-related charitable organizations through the IRONAID COVID-19 Support Fund grants. An additional 70 organizations have received support through Operation IRONAID Nutrition or Operation IRONAID Face Masks in partnership with Framebridge and Good360, bringing support to 230 organizations and impact to more than 2.5 million people globally through meal distribution, face coverings and grant funding for organizations supporting youth, the homeless, seniors, veterans and other vulnerable populations, as well as groups focused on research and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene).

<p>“We stand with our event communities, athletes, volunteers, and staff as well as their families and friends who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating wildfires in Canada and Northern California,” shared Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “When disaster strikes our race communities, like the serious situation with the California wildfires, we call upon our Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series and IRONMAN community to support relief efforts. We thank all of our athletes, partners and donors for their generosity that allows us to continue to give during these times of extreme need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<em>– More than 50,000 new and unused shirts will be turned into 500,000 non-sterile face masks and supporting the production of 100,000 acrylic face shields</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">
<em>– First batch distributed to Professional Firefighters of Arizona and to City of San Francisco for distribution to the city’s most vulnerable populations</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(April 27, 2020) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup>, Framebridge and Good360 have announced that they have partnered for Operation IRONAID<sup>®</sup> Face Masks, a program that will bring non-sterile face masks and other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to first responders, hospitals and other organizations in need across the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, these brands are joining forces to repurpose more than 50,000 new and unused shirts into 500,000 non-sterile face masks and supporting the production of 100,000 acrylic face shields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This past weekend, during the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> VR<sup>TM</sup> Challenge Facebook Live broadcast, the IRONMAN Foundation announced the first round of Operation IRONAID Face Masks donations. With the support of United States Senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema, 7,500 non-sterile masks and 7,500 acrylic face shields will be distributed to the Professional Firefighters of Arizona. In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation announced on Sunday that the City of San Francisco will receive 5,000 non-sterile face masks for distribution to the city’s vulnerable populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> community like Michael Kane, Senior Vice President Operations and Supply Chain at Framebridge, stepped up to the plate to offer support in the form of production capabilities, and Good360 joined in to manage logistics and transport raw materials and finished products to the first responders and hospitals who need them most. IRONMAN Foundation ambassador Bethany Smith also assisted with elevating the collaboration and found an opportunity with her employer, Beam Suntory, a world leader in premium spirits, to provide 18,624 new and unused shirts to be made into non-sterile and non-branded face masks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During this dynamic time, our greatest strength is in coming together, combining our resources and talents to make a positive difference in these uncertain times,” expressed Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “With a shortage of protective masks throughout the world, we recognize the ability to make a positive difference with Operation IRONAID Face Masks. We are also looking forward to working with race operators and organizations around the world to help with the creation of non-sterile face masks from new and unused shirts. We recognize that this is a challenging time, but our community is committed to working together to continue to create a lasting impact.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Framebridge, a company known for making easy and affordable custom frames, transformed its manufacturing facility in Lexington, Ky. from making frames to producing non-sterile face masks with new and unused race shirts provided by the IRONMAN Foundation, as well as acrylic face shields for those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Framebridge will produce more than 15,000 non-sterile face masks a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At Framebridge, we are honored to support frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic through the manufacturing of PPE. We’re proud to have quickly pivoted our custom framing operation and team to produce droplet masks and acrylic face shields when the need emerged. We are excited to work with the IRONMAN Foundation on Operation IRONAID Face Masks to make a positive impact together,” shared Mike Kane, Senior VP Operations and Supply Chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good360 is the global leader in product philanthropy and purposeful giving. The organization is committed to its mission of helping transform the lives of those in need through the distribution of essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Good360 will manage logistics and transportation of the new and unused race shirts to Framebridge’s facility in Lexington, Ky., and the finished non-sterile face masks to first responders, hospitals and others who are combating the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Being part of this collaboration to provide face masks and other PPE to first responders during this crisis makes us exceptionally proud,” said Matt Connelly, CEO of Good360. “Our proven track record as a humanitarian supply chain, delivering goods to those in critical need, enables us to be part of this creative cross-sector solution. By leveraging each of our organization’s individual strengths, we are more effective together in supporting those on the frontlines doing great work.”  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation is also accepting donations of sterile masks to be used as PPE for distribution through the Operation IRONAID Face Masks program. Race operators and organizations with new and unused race shirts are encouraged to donate these items to the IRONMAN Foundation to be made into non-sterile face masks and distributed to help keep at-risk individuals safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to Operation IRONAID Face Masks, the IRONMAN Foundation has expanded its IRONAID<sup>® </sup>program to include the IRONAID COVID-19 pandemic Support Fund. To date, over $160,000 has been raised and will go towards providing grants to health-related nonprofit organizations around the world who have launched COVID-19 pandemic response programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(March 27, 2020) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> has announced that in 2020, its existing IRONAID<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png"> program will expand its resources to specifically focus on serving event communities in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. IRONAID engages athletes in the healthcare industry who race IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> and IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup>
  <sup> </sup>events, with the goal of raising funds and awareness for health-related causes. This year, all athletes will have the opportunity to support IRONAID, including Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series<sup>®</sup> participants through Rock This Town<sup>®</sup>, a program of the IRONMAN Foundation and the charitable program for the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At The IRONMAN Group, we are committed to supporting people impacted by this global crisis, especially in the communities where we operate,” said Andrew Messick, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer for The IRONMAN Group. “We know that we can do much more together than we can alone, which is why we are working to provide essential resources to health-related nonprofit organizations around the world to help those who need it most.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To kick-off the campaign, over $50,000 has already been committed to IRONAID through private and partner donations. Additionally, for the first IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Virtual Racing<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png">(VR)<em> </em>Pro Challenge scheduled for April 4 and 5, 2020, the IRONMAN Foundation will match all donations made during the race up to USD $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community members that would like to join us in supporting IRONAID’s commitment can make donations at any time through the IRONAID website – <a href="http://www.ironmanfoundation.org/ironaid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.ironmanfoundation.org/ironaid</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, recognizing that the immediate needs of communities will be different than those that will emerge in the months ahead, the IRONMAN Foundation has also established Operation IRONAID Face Masks, a program that repurposes new and unused event shirts into non-sterile face masks. The masks will be provided to COVID-19 patients upon discharge from the hospital to help keep others safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the world is faced with the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRONMAN Foundation stands with the global community and recognizes the ability to make a positive difference in these uncertain times with IRONAID,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “Thanks to generous private and partner donations, we are pleased to kick off the campaign with over $50,000 USD already committed to IRONAID in addition to a matching donation campaign of $10,000 from the IRONMAN Foundation during the first IRONMAN VR<em> </em>Pro Challenge. To further amplify these important efforts, a portion of the fundraising efforts by TEAM IMF Athletes will also be dedicated to the IRONAID support fund in 2020. We are also looking forward to working with race operators and organizations around the world to help with the creation of non-sterile face masks from new and unused event shirts. We recognize that this is a challenging time, but our community is committed to working together to continue to create a lasting and tangible impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>IRONAID funds will be available for grant applications by health-related nonprofit organizations around the world. Organizations who fit the criteria are invited to apply for funding. Potential projects include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing personal, protective equipment (PPE) and supplies such as ventilators, CT/x-ray machines, etc.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supporting programs in the areas of housing/homelessness, healthcare, nutrition/food support, mental health, domestic violence, care for seniors, etc.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Funding to support vulnerable individuals in quarantine.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Funding organizations that are working in areas with poor access to regular medical services. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide">



<p>
      <strong>To our global community,</strong>
      </p>



<p>We know that both our athletes and our communities want to be racing; we do too.</p>



<p>While The IRONMAN Group’s mission is to provide exceptional, life-changing race experiences for athletes of all levels, from their first step to the finish line, we can only accomplish this by providing the safest possible environment, and safeguarding the citizens of our host communities.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has substantially altered the global sports landscape and will have material impact on the mass participation industry in the immediate term. We want to reassure you that the health and well-being of our community is our primary concern. To this end, we are doing our part to communicate effectively and follow public health agencies and governmental authorities’ recommendations.</p>



<p>We expect that there are going to be substantial and widespread event postponements in the coming weeks and months. The decision to proceed, restrict, modify or postpone an event will be based on availability of community resources and ongoing event-specific risk assessment in coordination with the relevant healthcare and government authorities and the IRONMAN Global Medical Advisory Board, an independent medical advisory board focused on health and safety.</p>



<p>For events that will continue, The IRONMAN Group, along with the IRONMAN Global Medical Advisory Board, has outlined a series of pragmatic and practical actions designed to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 or any other infectious agent to athletes and to members of our host communities. These steps will help athletes achieve their goals while allowing communities to secure the benefits of hosting mass participation sporting events. They will be implemented worldwide at all IRONMAN Group events beginning March 19 and will continue indefinitely.</p>



<p>
      <strong>Self-care and Risk Minimization</strong>
      </p>



<p>Athletes who are sick or have been potentially exposed to an infectious agent must not compete or attend events, as this puts others at risk. As a community, we each have a personal responsibility to protect each other by complying with this rule.</p>



<p>We ask that all athletes, volunteers and partners follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for basic protective measures against the new coronavirus:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
        <li>Regularly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash your hands with soap and water, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
          <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
            <li>Practice good respiratory hygiene. Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of used tissues immediately and appropriately in a bin.</li>
            </ul>



<p>
            <strong>Providing Flexibility to Athletes</strong>
            </p>



<p>Certain races will be postponed or cancelled due to the outbreak and we will communicate these as soon as practical. Our goal will be to move the race to a date later in the year. We work in close partnership with the relevant public health authorities in the territories where the races take place and err on the side of safety for our athletes and the host community. If an event cannot occur on the scheduled date, we will take the following actions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Postponement</strong>:&nbsp; Registered athletes for events that are postponed due to COVID-19 by the local health authorities are automatically transferred to the rescheduled date. For those that the new date does not work, we will allow deferrals into the same event the next year.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cancellation:</strong>&nbsp;Registered athletes for events that are cancelled due to COVID-19 by the local health authorities are automatically deferred to the same race in 2021.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Other options:</strong>&nbsp;We are vetting other options to allow displaced athletes to race in 2020 and will communicate those in due course.</li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Athletes in Quarantined/Restricted</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Territories</strong>: For athletes in certain designated quarantine or restricted territories who have registered for races that take place before June 1, 2020 and have NOT been postponed or cancelled, we will aid in finding alternative races later in the season.</li>
                          </ul>



<p>
                          <strong>
                            <em>For those who are sick, feel unwell, or have been potentially exposed to an infectious agent in advance of a race that&nbsp;will&nbsp;take place, do not come to the race; instead seek medical care. Once you have done so, contact the relevant Athlete Services representative for your race and we will attempt to find you another solution.</em>
                            </strong>
                          </p>



<p>
                          <strong>Safe Event Experience</strong>
                          </p>



<p>In order to provide the safest experience for our athletes, we are instituting the following at our races, effective March 19.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
                          <li>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern as it relates to the COVID-19.&nbsp;In response, and to prevent the virus from spreading further, governments around the world are taking a wide set of measures, including limitations on gatherings, events, and school activities, as well as travel and entry restrictions.</p>



<p>We are monitoring the situation with public health officials to follow and implement measures dictated by health agencies and governments. We will continue to take appropriate actions on an event-by-event basis, following the decisions made by these respective authorities and agencies.</p>



<p>Additional information will be shared with athletes and our partners as appropriate and will be made available on event pages and social media accounts. We ask you to stay updated with respect to the impact of the outbreak in your location, follow governmental and agency recommendations to minimize risk, and follow any potential restrictions put in place. Anyone traveling for competition purposes should make themselves familiar with respective national and world health organization updates in those locations as well as travel policies from airlines and hotels. As always, athletes should monitor their personal health appropriately and not race or travel to any event if they are unwell.</p>



<p>Athletes are also reminded to practice hygiene protection measures&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended by the WHO</a>.</p>

                                                      <em>More than $50,000 raised to support local recovery efforts with service project scheduled for race week</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
                                                        <strong>TAMPA, Fla./SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</strong> (March 11, 2020) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will return to Puerto Rico for continued Hurricane Maria recovery efforts in conjunction with the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Puerto Rico Presented by Discover Puerto Rico triathlon, which will be held on March 15, 2020. The support includes a large-scale service project in partnership with Fundación Buena Vibra and Parceleras Afro-Caribeñas por la Transformación Barrial (PATBA), where more than 60 athletes and volunteers will help improve a community center in Barrios Saint Just and San Antón on Monday, March 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners, we are honored to return to Puerto Rico to support ongoing recovery efforts,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “It’s a privilege to support the inspiring and innovative work of our nonprofit partners. We look forward to welcoming athletes and volunteers who are traveling from around the world to ‘Race for Puerto Rico’ and participate in our hands-on community service initiatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
                                                          <strong>Service Projects and Grant Awards</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, March 16, athletes and volunteers will return to Barrios Saint Just and San Antón for a day of community impact in partnership with local nonprofit partners Fundación Buena Vibra and PATBA. The volunteers will work in teams to create a public space and fruit forest in the green spaces that surround La Conde, a school that was closed because of Hurricane Maria and converted to a community center.&nbsp; In addition, volunteers will assemble care packages for women, men and children. Migrant Health Centers, Inc. will distribute the care packages throughout the island of Puerto Rico, including areas impacted by the recent earthquakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At Fundación Buena Vibra, we feel proud to take part in the amazing initiative that is IRONMAN Foundation Volunteer Day. This time around, we’ll be working alongside a group of inspiring, powerful women that are making an impact through PATBA. We believe that joining forces is the winning formula to achieve great things for our people and our communities,” said Emil Medina, President of Fundación Buena Vibra.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mapenzie Nono, president of PATBA, emphasized her excitement over the collaboration. “For PATBA, it is an honor to receive IRONMAN Foundation support again to continue advancing our Social Justice proposal in the community center of La Conde. Our plan for the Volunteer Day is to create public green areas and a fruit forest for artistic programming as well as culinary and holistic health spaces. These projects will impact generations for years to come and make San Antón a model of sustainability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grants will be awarded to the service project partner organizations: Fundación Buena Vibra and PATBA. Funding was raised by donations to the Humanitarian Relief Effort campaign, as well as the TEAM IMF athletes participating in the IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico Presented by Discover Puerto Rico triathlon. Grant recipients will be recognized at the IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico awards ceremony on Sunday, March 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We stand with the staff of The IRONMAN Group regional office in Nashville along with the local community and call upon our greater IRONMAN and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series community to join us in helping bring assistance in this time of need,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “The areas affected will require ongoing assistance and donations, and service projects will be critically important for their continued recovery efforts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an effort to give back to the local Nashville community, Rock This Town will offer a hands-on Service Project Day taking place on Sunday, April 26 to assist the community with rebuilding.

The 2020 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team is comprised of 33 carefully selected members: two team captains, 25 age-group triathletes, and six professional triathletes. The Mālama Club will comprise a total of 17 individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have an extraordinary group of athletes serving as IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors this season,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “This includes seven special age-group Ambassadors who will specifically spearhead three programs: the Gold Star Initiative military program, the IRONAID program for athletes in the healthcare industry, and the IRONMAN University coaching program, linking our athletes to IRONMAN U programming and support.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last season, with support of IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors, the IRONMAN Foundation provided $1.8 million in grant funding to more than 1,500 local, regional, national, and global nonprofit initiatives throughout IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>, IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup>, and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series<sup>®</sup> communities. In addition, nearly 1,600 volunteers provided hands-on help in IRONMAN race communities through various service projects. Each service project benefits local nonprofit partner organizations, powerfully linking athletes to the local community and leaving a positive legacy behind long after race day. This has included the Bike for a Kid pop-up service project, an IRONMAN Foundation and FLO Cycling program, which will expand its impact this year through the support of PLAYTRI, the Official Triathlon Store of IRONMAN. A full list of 2020 IRONMAN Foundation Service projects can be found <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/service-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Athletes, TriClubs, volunteers, and their supporters are invited to join us at IRONMAN and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series events throughout the season as we connect with our local race communities for unique, life-changing opportunities,” Hartmann continued. “When we unite for a common purpose – changing lives through sport – we leave our IRONMAN legacy behind long after race day.”&nbsp;</p>

During each event, Mike wears the names of his fallen Marine Corps brothers on his race kit and dedicates the races to their memories and families. Last year, Mike piloted an IRONMAN Foundation program called the Gold Star Initiative. This initiative gives veterans and active duty service members the chance to team up and honor Gold Star Families by carrying an American flag during the run portion of select IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events, which is presented&nbsp; to a local Gold Star Family at the finish line.

The 2020 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team is comprised of 33 carefully selected members: two team captains, 25 age-group triathletes, and six professional triathletes. The Mālama Club will comprise a total of 17 individuals. </p>



<p>“We have an extraordinary group of athletes serving as IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors this season,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “This includes seven special age-group Ambassadors who will specifically spearhead three programs: the Gold Star Initiative military program, the IRONAID program for athletes in the healthcare industry, and the IRONMAN University coaching program, linking our athletes to IRONMAN U programming and support.”</p>



<p>Last season, with support of IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors, the IRONMAN Foundation provided $1.8 million in grant funding to more than 1,500 local, regional, national, and global nonprofit initiatives throughout IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>, IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup>, and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series<sup>®</sup> communities. In addition, nearly 1,600 volunteers provided hands-on help in IRONMAN race communities through various service projects. Each service project benefits local nonprofit partner organizations, powerfully linking athletes to the local community and leaving a positive legacy behind long after race day. This has included the Bike for a Kid pop-up service project, an IRONMAN Foundation and FLO Cycling program, which will expand its impact this year through the support of PLAYTRI, the Official Triathlon Store of IRONMAN.</p>

He took part in the heavy urban combat during the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. While there, 29 of his battalion brothers lost their lives. Once he returned to the United States, Mike self-medicated to numb the pain. After being diagnosed with PTSD, Mike turned to triathlon as a healthy recovery tool. During each event, Mike wears the names of his fallen Marine Corps brothers on his race kit and dedicates the races to their memories and families. Last year, Mike piloted an IRONMAN Foundation program called the Gold Star Initiative. This initiative gives veterans and active duty service members the chance to team up and honor Gold Star Families by carrying an American flag during the run portion of select IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events, which is presented&nbsp; to a local Gold Star Family at the finish line. He will continue to lead the program in 2020 with fellow ambassador and Gold Star Mother, Lisa Anderson.</p>

<p>The Women for Tri TriClub Grant Program was established to support local triathlon clubs as they develop programming and activities to increase female participation in triathlon. Benefiting clubs will utilize funds to provide specific training for female triathletes with a focus on removing barriers to participation, educational programs for female triathletes, and networking and social gatherings with a focus on recruiting and engaging women to participate in triathlon. Since the program’s inception in 2016, more than $300,000 has been awarded to 90 triathlon clubs. This year, the Women for Tri TriClub Grant Applications will be open from Thursday, February 20, 2020 until 11:59 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 5, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women For Tri<sup>®</sup>, a program of The IRONMAN Foundation launched by IRONMAN in 2015, works to increase female participation at all levels of triathlon.

Since inception, over $300,000 in grants have been awarded to triathlon clubs supporting female participation initiatives.

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> has today launched a global Humanitarian Relief Campaign to provide support for those affected by the devastating bushfires across Australia. </p>



<p>To start off the Humanitarian
Relief Campaign, the IRONMAN Foundation has made a $75,000 AUD donation to
assist communities in need. Funds raised through the campaign will be directed
towards a number of groups and programs in Australia, including the Red Cross,
the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital and the Blue Mountains Bushfire Mayoral
Relief Fund.</p>



<p>“The thoughts of everyone at The IRONMAN Group are with those who have been impacted by the devastating bushfires across Australia,” said Andrew Messick, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer for The IRONMAN Group. “Athletes, volunteers, staff and their family and friends have been affected, and so it is important that we band together to make a difference during this difficult time.”</p>



<p>Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation
said, “We’re incredibly grateful that we’re able to launch this global Humanitarian
Relief Campaign through the IRONMAN Foundation and make a real difference to
those communities that are in need. Our IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> ‘Ohana is
incredibly generous, and we look forward to making a difference in Australia
thanks to their support.”</p>



<p>Dave Beeche, Managing
Director of Oceania for The IRONMAN Group said, “It
is hard to fathom the scale of the tragedy that is taking place and the impacts
on people, wildlife and the environment. I am in awe of the extraordinary
efforts of the fire service, other emergency services and so many others
involved in trying to control the fires and provide all the necessary help for
those impacted.</p>



<p>“The IRONMAN Group is proud that so many of our events take
part in regional areas of Australia and this fundraising campaign will allow us
to do our part to help these communities rebuild. Your homes are our homes and
make our events the experiences they are for our participants and we are
committing to supporting you now and into the future,” he said. </p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation
has set up&nbsp;multiple initiatives&nbsp;to support those affected by the
Australian bushfires at <a href="http://www.ironmanfoundation.org/relief">www.ironmanfoundation.org/relief</a>: </p>

<p>When the Category 5 Hurricane made landfall in October, 2018, Hurricane Michael was one of the strongest storms to ever hit the Florida Panhandle. In its devastation, IRONMAN and local partners concluded that it would not be feasible to host the 20<sup>th</sup> edition of the IRONMAN Florida triathlon in its usual location of Panama City Beach, Florida prompting the relocation to Haines City, the home of IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Florida. The IRONMAN Foundation, along with generous support from HOKA ONE ONE, the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and the IRONMAN community around the world raised over $200,000 in Humanitarian Relief to support the region’s needs, which will include a large-scale community rebuilding project on Sunday, November 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we return to Panama City Beach and Bay County for the upcoming IRONMAN 70.3 Gulf Coast and November’s IRONMAN Florida, we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with Panama City to create cutting-edge, sustainable housing solutions and bring more families home,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “We invite our community of IRONMAN athletes, their families and friends to join us to race and help rebuild the community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The housing branch of the Bay County Long Term Recovery Task Force has been very aggressive and innovative in identifying potential solutions for the housing crisis. Returning families to a normal and healthy living environment is critical to maintaining health and well-being in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(March 11, 2019) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> announced today the 2019 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team and recent inductions into the Mālama Club. The 2019 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team consists of 27 carefully selected members. The Mālama Club will comprise 16 individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors have been chosen for their outstanding involvement in their own communities and will continue to exemplify what it means to ‘Race for More’ by focusing their efforts on the IRONMAN Foundation’s 22 giveback initiatives this season. Leading the IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador team will be Team Captain and the “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Having the honor of representing the IRONMAN Foundation as the Ambassador Captain is one of the highlights of my career,” said Mike Reilly, IRONMAN Public Address Announcer. “To be able to give back and help those in need throughout our IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> communities is very gratifying and needed. I am looking forward to continuing that role in 2019 and hope others consider being a part of the IRONMAN Foundation team this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After considerable servitude with the IRONMAN Foundation in past years, eight-time IRONMAN World Champion and IRONMAN and USA Triathlon Hall of Famer, Paula Newby Fraser will officially join the ambassador team for 2019. Five current professional triathletes will join “The Queen of Kona” as part of the IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team, including Mirinda Carfrae, a three-time IRONMAN World Champion, along with husband Timothy O’Donnell, a multi-year IRONMAN World Championship top-ten finisher. They are joined by former Olympic athlete, and USA Triathlon Olympic/ITU Athlete of the Year, Sarah True. Also new to the team is 2016 and 2017 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Africa Champion Ben Hoffman and Matt Russell, who made a remarkable comeback and placed sixth at the 2018 IRONMAN World Championship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve enjoyed working with the IRONMAN Foundation, especially the hands-on projects that are making a direct impact in the communities where we enjoy racing,” said Mirinda Carfrae. “The interaction with the IRONMAN Foundation’s athletes is inspiring and if I can help support their efforts and that of the Foundation then it’s a win for so many.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Age-group athlete ambassadors include Shannon Spake, Mike Ergo and Derek Fitzgerald. Shannon Spake is a multiple IRONMAN 70.3 race finisher and a veteran sports broadcaster. After spending 10 years at ESPN, Spake joined FOX Sports in July 2016 as a three-sport star, covering NASCAR, college football, college basketball and the NFL. In 2019, she was named host of FOX NASCAR’s race coverage, handling all anchor duties for MONSTER ENERGY NASCAR CUP SERIES and NASCAR XFINITY SERIES races and prerace shows. Most recently, Spake voiced the role of “Shannon Spokes” in Disney Pixar’s Cars 3. Despite being diagnosed with scoliosis as a child and undergoing back surgery at thirteen, she swam competitively through high school and college and has been committed to staying active ever since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Ergo is a Marine Corps veteran who completed several tours in Iraq. He took part in the heavy urban combat during the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. While there, 29 of his battalion brothers lost their lives. Once he returned to the United States, Mike self-medicated to numb the pain. After he was diagnosed with PTSD, Mike used triathlon as a recovery tool. During each event, Mike wears the names of his fallen Marine Corps brothers on his race kit and dedicates the races to their memory and families. Last year, Ergo piloted an IRONMAN Foundation program called the Gold Star Initiative, giving veterans and active duty service members the chance to team up and honor Gold Star Families by carrying an American flag during the run portion of select IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events and presenting it to a local Gold Star Family at the finish line. He will continue to lead the program in 2019 with fellow ambassador and Gold Star Mother, Lisa Andereson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At age 40, Derek Fitzgerald became the first American heart transplant recipient to complete a full-distance IRONMAN race. Before that, he spent a decade battling cancer and heart failure as he suffered from Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. After his first IRONMAN 70.3 triathlon, he co-founded the Tin Man Endurance Team consisting exclusively of heart transplant recipients. He also created a new foundation called The Recycledman Foundation whose mission is to educate and inspire supporters of advancements in cancer research, heart health, and organ donation. As an entrepreneur and technologist, Derek has spent over 15 years creating successful tech companies that specialize in building solutions for pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, the IRONMAN Foundation expanded its ambassador program by launching the Mālama Club. Embodying the spirit of the Hawaiian word Mālama, meaning to “take care of, preserve and protect,” a team of 16 IRONMAN athletes will continue to support the IRONMAN Foundation’s mission of creating positive, tangible change in race communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the Mālama Club include Marcus Cook and Dr. Timothy Deer. Last year, Marcus raced in the IRONMAN World Championship and raised $100,000 in support of the IRONMAN Foundation. The 46-year-old oil and gas executive lost over 250 pounds and continues to find ways to use his story to impact those he knows and those he hasn’t met. Dr. Timothy Deer has raced in support of the IRONMAN Foundation for many seasons. This year, Dr. Deer will help lead a new IRONMAN Foundation program engaging the medical community to support health-related causes. New additions to the Mālama Club include Mike Berland of New York City and Stephanie Middleton of Hingham, Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an extraordinary moment when an IRONMAN athlete has the opportunity to connect directly with the cause they support and make a difference in their race community,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “Our 2019 Ambassador and Mālama Club athletes truly embody our mantra of ‘Service Through Sport and Commitment to Community,’ and we are deeply grateful for their service and support.”&nbsp;</p>

The support includes a large-scale service project in partnership with the Buena Vibra Foundation, where more than 80 athletes and volunteers will help restore a community center in Barrios Saint Just and San Antón on Monday, March 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners, we are honored to return to Puerto Rico to support ongoing recovery efforts,” said Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “It’s a privilege to support the inspiring and innovative work of our nonprofit partners. We look forward to welcoming athletes and volunteers who are traveling from around the world to ‘Race for Puerto Rico’ and participate in our hands-on community service initiatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <strong>Service Projects and Grant Awards</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to race day on Saturday, March 16, IRONMAN Foundation athletes traveling from around the world to compete will have the opportunity to participate in a yoga workshop with local first responders and community residents as they work to combat post-traumatic stress. Held at the headquarters of Foundation for Puerto Rico, this yoga session will be hosted in partnership with the Give Back Yoga Foundation, the Holistic Life Foundation and the Clinton Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A year and a half after the devastating hurricane season of 2017, communities in Puerto Rico and across the Caribbean continue to face challenges related to post-traumatic stress and mental health support for residents and first responders,” said Bekah Curtis-Heald, Senior Manager at the Clinton Global Initiative. “This workshop that kicks off IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico weekend is an exciting wellness opportunity for the community and provides a spotlight on a health crisis that is too often overlooked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Holistic Life Foundation is excited to be a part of such an amazing collaboration with the IRONMAN Foundation, Give Back Yoga Foundation, Foundation for Puerto Rico and the Clinton Foundation to help support the people of Puerto Rico,” said Andres Gonzalez, Co-Founder and Marketing Director for the Holistic Life Foundation.  “We hope to make a sustainable impact on the island by training local residents and first responders with yoga and mindfulness techniques that can be passed on to their communities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, March 18, athletes and volunteers will travel to Barrios Saint Just and San Antón for a day of community impact in partnership with local nonprofit partners Fundación Buena Vibra and HASER. The volunteers will work in teams, collaborating directly with community residents and leaders to transform a school that was closed because of the hurricane into a new community center, including meeting rooms and a gazebo. The experience will conclude with live music and a family-style dinner for participants and community members. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s inspiring to see how the Saint Just and San Antón neighborhoods can bring together so many people and organizations in support of their vision,” said Colibrí Sanfiorenzo Barnhard, HASER’s Executive Director. “The community is remaking a closed school into the beating heart of a larger project to improve their quality of life and create the conditions they need to thrive. That much energy and determination is contagious.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fundación Buena Vibra was originally created to help foster the arts and culture of Puerto Rico, and today we help bridge the gap between donors and the non-profit culture of our island,” said Emil Medina, President of Fundación Buena Vibra. “Our organization is proud to contribute to the development of Barrios San Antón and Saint Just. We hope this volunteer day is the first of many more collaborations with HASER, IRONMAN Foundation, and above all, with the residents and community leaders working to make these communities more resilient and empowered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Registration for the service project is available until March 16 at <a href="http://www.ironmanfoundation.org/puerto-rico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.ironmanfoundation.org/puerto-rico</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grants will be awarded to the service project partner organizations: Fundación Buena Vibra, HASER and Give Back Yoga. Funding was raised by donations to the Humanitarian Relief Effort campaign, as well as the TEAM IMF and TEAM IMF | MORE IMPACT athletes participating in the event. Grant recipients will be recognized at the IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico awards ceremony on Sunday, March 17.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Through the support and generosity of the IRONMAN community, including our athletes racing on TEAM IMF and TEAM IMF | MORE IMPACT, the IRONMAN Foundation is honored to continue to support the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico,” said Michael Lynn Sills, Community Relations Manager for the IRONMAN Foundation. “It is humbling to see the community come together with the hope of making a difference in the lives of those impacted by Hurricane Maria.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building on a lifetime of public service, President Clinton established the Clinton Foundation on the simple belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, everyone has a responsibility to act, and we all do better when we work together. For nearly two decades, that premise has energized the work of the Foundation in overcoming complex challenges and improving the lives of people across the United States and around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an operating foundation, we work on issues directly or with strategic partners from the business, government, and nonprofit sectors to create economic opportunity, improve public health, and inspire civic engagement and service. Our programs are designed to make a real difference today while serving as proven models for tomorrow. The goal of every effort is to use available resources to get better results faster – at the lowest possible cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We firmly believe that when diverse groups of people bring resources together in the spirit of true cooperation, transformative ideas will emerge to drive life-changing action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, the IRONMAN Foundation provided more than $120,000 in grant funding to five local nonprofits to support Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and more than 100 athletes and volunteers participated in a rebuilding project the day after IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico, helping to revitalize the homes and community of Barrio Ingenio, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria. Grant funding supported the Buena Vibra Foundation’s ongoing roof reconstruction work, and IRONMAN Foundation volunteers were transported to Barrio Ingenio for a Community Revitalization Volunteer Day. Working as teams in collaboration with community residents and leaders, volunteers cleared debris, painted and cleaned several homes. Together we were able to create a long-term, lasting impact and assist with the emotional revitalization of the community by turning their post-hurricane shelters back into a vibrant community of homes.

The bike build takes only five minutes, includes a personal note to the child who will receive it and provides athletes and their supporters the opportunity to connect to local youth, sending them the message to “Stay strong, ride safe and believe in your dreams!” As part of <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="10" data-gr-id="10">race</g> weekend, the IRONMAN Foundation and FLO Cycling delivered the bikes to kids in partnership with a local nonprofit organization, powerfully linking our athletes to the local community and leaving the IRONMAN legacy behind long after race day. In 2019, we’ll build 800 bikes in nine (9) race communities!</li>

Through these initiatives, children on opposite ends of the world, were able to take part in swim lessons, learning basic techniques and water safety. Skills and lessons learned through these initiatives promoted self-confidence and independence, as well as the importance of living an active lifestyle. </li>

The service project was supported by IRONMAN partners including HOKA ONE ONE, CLIF Bar and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation. In addition to the service project, the IRONMAN Foundation hosted a community 5k, where proceeds from the event supported the Santa Rosa Parks Foundation. This funding provided support to rebuild local parks impacted by the fires.</li>

IRONMAN athletes, ambassadors, partners and staff spent the morning restoring coastal landscape of anchialine pools to benefit the ahupuaʻa of Keahuolū in North Kona, an area of land that spans 3,400 acres and serves as a location for Native Hawaiian children to experience ‘ohana-oriented camping. In addition, the Liliʻuokalani Trust was awarded a $2,500 grant to sponsor ongoing programs to benefit local youth. </li>

The island suffered an estimated $90 billion in damages and rebuilding efforts will likely take years. Shortly after the storm hit, the IRONMAN Foundation launched a Humanitarian Relief Effort campaign to assist in the recovery. In March 2018, the IRONMAN Foundation awarded $120,000 in grant funding to five local nonprofit organizations in conjunction with IRONMAN 70.3 Puerto Rico. This funding will support long-term recovery needs in five areas: reforestation, water quality, solar power, hunger <g class="gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="12" data-gr-id="12">and</g> home restoration. In addition to grant funding, the IRONMAN Foundation partnered with the Buena Vibra Foundation for a race week service project, where 125 athletes and volunteers helped restore homes and revitalize the community of Barrio Ingenio in Toa Baja.</li>

<p>To start off the Humanitarian Relief Campaign, the IRONMAN Foundation has made a $75,000 AUD donation to assist communities in need. Funds raised through the campaign will be directed towards a number of groups and programs in Australia, including the Red Cross, the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital and the Blue Mountains Bushfire Mayoral Relief Fund.</p>



<p>“The thoughts of everyone at The IRONMAN Group are with those who have been impacted by the devastating bushfires across Australia,” said Andrew Messick, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer for The IRONMAN Group. “Athletes, volunteers, staff and their family and friends have been affected, and so it is important that we band together to make a difference during this difficult time.”</p>



<p>Sarah Hartmann, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation said, “We’re incredibly grateful that we’re able to launch this global Humanitarian Relief Campaign through the IRONMAN Foundation and make a real difference to those communities that are in need. Our IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;‘Ohana is incredibly generous, and we look forward to making a difference in Australia thanks to their support.”</p>



<p>Dave Beeche, Managing Director of Oceania for The IRONMAN Group said, “It is hard to fathom the scale of the tragedy that is taking place and the impacts on people, wildlife and the environment. I am in awe of the extraordinary efforts of the fire service, other emergency services and so many others involved in trying to control the fires and provide all the necessary help for those impacted.</p>



<p>“The IRONMAN Group is proud that so many of our events take part in regional areas of Australia and this fundraising campaign will allow us to do our part to help these communities rebuild. Your homes are our homes and make our events the experiences they are for our participants and we are committing to supporting you now and into the future,” he said.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation in partnership with the Liliʻuokalani Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to serving orphans and destitute children throughout the Hawaiian Islands will continue its mission of creating tangible impact in race communities with a special service project. On Monday, October 8, IRONMAN athletes, ambassadors, partners and staff will spend the morning restoring coastal landscape of anchialine pools to benefit the ahupuaʻa of Keahuolū in North Kona, an area of land that spans 3,400 acres and serves as a location for Native Hawaiian children to experience ‘ohana-oriented camping. In addition, the Liliʻuokalani Trust will receive a $2,500 grant to sponsor ongoing programs to benefit local youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p> &nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will also present a special grant for $1,406 to PATH Hawai`i at the 32<sup>nd</sup> Annual PATH 5K and 10K run taking place on Sunday, October 7. PATH works with Hawai`i state and county, local leaders, and community members to safely connect people and places on Hawaiian islands with bikeways, sidewalks and pathways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are truly honored to partner with these organizations to provide funding or support for their initiatives,” said Sarah Hartmann, acting Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we’re leaving a positive and lasting impact here on the Island of Hawai`i.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the IRONMAN Foundation raised over $70,000 through the Humanitarian Relief Effort campaign in response to the multiple natural disasters that significantly impacted the Island of Hawai`i earlier this year – the largest earthquake to hit the region in over four decades, as well as the Kilauea Volcano eruptions and lava flows, which reached over 100 acres of land, destroying homes and displacing over a thousand residents. Funds will support the ongoing relief efforts of organizations in the Puna region.

<p>In partnership with FLO Cycling, the IRONMAN Foundation will host a “Bike for a Kid” pop-up service project in the IRONMAN Village on Tuesday, October 9 through Friday, October 12. IRONMAN World Championship athletes, along with their families and friends, are invited to visit the IRONMAN Foundation booth to assemble bikes for local kids in need. A total of 100 bikes will be built and distributed to children within the region through a partnership with Kids Matter, an organization that assists victims of child abuse and neglect and promotes confidence building among at-risk youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further help children become involved in sport and live a healthy and active lifestyle, IRONMAN Global Bike Partner, Ventum, as well as FLO Cycling and the IRONMAN Foundation have committed to raising at least $10,000 during race week. These funds will provide an additional 200 bikes to children in need through the Bike for a Kid program.

Due to the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Michael, IRONMAN and local partners concluded that it would not be feasible to host the 20<sup>th</sup> edition of IRONMAN Florida in its usual location of Panama City Beach, Florida prompting the relocation to Haines City, the home of IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3 Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the Category 4 storm made landfall, it was the strongest hurricane to ever hit the Florida Panhandle, with winds hitting 155 mph. At its peak, more than 1.5 million homes and businesses from Florida to Virginia were without power and it will be months before power is fully restored in the hardest hit areas. Thousands of residents have lost their homes and will need continued support as they work get back on their feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we mark the 20<sup>th</sup> year of IRONMAN Florida, our thoughts are with the Panama City Beach region and the community members who continue to be impacted by Hurricane Michael,” said Sarah Hartmann, Acting Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are calling upon our greater IRONMAN community to join us in helping to bring assistance in this time of need. The areas affected will require ongoing assistance and donations, and service projects will be critically important for their continued recovery efforts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation has set up multiple initiatives to help with Hurricane Michael Relief Efforts: &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our thoughts are with athletes, partners, volunteers and other local residents who continue to be impacted by Hurricane Florence,” said Sarah Hartmann, Acting Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are calling upon our greater IRONMAN community to join us in helping to bring assistance in this time of need. The areas affected will require ongoing assistance and donations, and service projects will be critically important for their continued recovery efforts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With Hurricane Florence having now moved through Wilmington and the Carolina’s, IRONMAN officials are working with the local authorities to assess and closely monitor the situation as it relates to the IRONMAN 70.3 North Carolina triathlon, scheduled to take place on Saturday, October 13,” said Keats McGonigal, Senior Regional Director, Mid-Atlantic Upper South Region for IRONMAN. “IRONMAN remains committed to creating a safe and positive race experience. However, we appreciate continued patience as the immediate need is to take care of the local residents. At the appropriate time, IRONMAN will communicate any changes that are necessary for future planned events based on the impact of Hurricane Florence.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twenty years—years filled with sweat and tears, ups and downs. With racing conditions that were perfect, and some that were far from ideal. Years filled with stories about the most inspirational athletes to toe the start line at an IRONMAN event, and of giving back and leaving our legacies long after race day.</p>
<p>This past week, the IRONMAN Foundation had the privilege of partaking in the celebration of 20 years at Lake Placid and continuing our mission to give back to the communities in which we race through grant funding and volunteerism. Here are the highlights:</p>

<p>Race week started with our second activation of “Bike for a Kid”&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_2142731134">on Thursday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;in IRONMAN Village, in partnership with FLO Cycling. Fifty bikes were built for local kids in Lake Placid and the surrounding communities, including members from Blue Star Families. Blue Star Families are committed to strengthening military families by connecting them with their neighbors—individuals and organizations—to create vibrant communities of mutual support. They believe that we’re all stronger when we take care of one another. The IRONMAN Foundation could not agree more.</span>

<p>On Thursday, in partnership with the Lake Placid Outing Club, over 30 volunteers made up of IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors, TEAM IMF and IRONMAN Athletes paired up with local kids from the Lake Placid community and together, learned how to stand-up paddleboard on Mirror Lake. IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team Captain Mike Reilly and Pro Triathlete Sarah Piampiano attended with other incredible volunteers. The day was filled with laughter and smiles, while the kids conquered their fears of being out on the open water!</p>

<p>A gorgeous race morning sunrise greeted all IRONMAN Foundation Athletes, as they finished up their pre-race preparations in transition before heading over to the swim start. However, Mother Nature did not wait long before she unleashed hard rain and strong winds out on the bike course. Despite the bike course conditions, the weather cleared up in time for the run and all of our TEAM IMF athletes crossed the finish line. Not only did they earn the designation of “IRONMAN,” but they were able to leave their IRONMAN legacy behind.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation® will partner with Rebuilding Together Petaluma and Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation for a service project, presented by HOKA ONE ONE, to build tiny houses for Santa Rosa residents still displaced by the Tubbs Wildfires that ripped through the region last October. In addition, an IRONMAN Foundation Community 5k is scheduled on Sunday morning, July 29 to support the Santa Rosa Parks Foundation. The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $111,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the&nbsp;Santa Rosa region&nbsp;in conjunction with the 2018 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;70.3<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Santa Rosa&nbsp;triathlon taking place on Saturday,&nbsp;July 28.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding Together Petaluma is thrilled to have the support of the IRONMAN Foundation and IRONMAN volunteers to build 10 decks for the new homes for fire survivors,” said Jane Hamilton, Executive Director of Rebuilding Together Petaluma. “This gives our fire recovery work a significant boost towards success.”</p>
<p>The service project on Sunday, July 29 at 10:00AM will bring together IRONMAN athletes and partners, including&nbsp;three-time&nbsp;IRONMAN World Champion&nbsp;Mirinda&nbsp;Carfrae and her husband,&nbsp;Timothy O’Donnell, a&nbsp;multi-year IRONMAN<sup>&nbsp;</sup>World Championship top ten finisher, who are both&nbsp;members&nbsp;of the IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team, as well as employees from HOKA ONE ONE and CLIF Bar.</p>
<p>“HOKA ONE ONE is honored to be able to support IRONMAN, the IRONMAN Foundation, and the process of rebuilding together,” said Wendy Yang, President of HOKA ONE ONE. “Our connection to the IRONMAN community, especially in our home state of California, goes well beyond the race itself, and it is humbling to see everyone come together to provide relief to our neighbors and friends.”</p>
<p>Additional service project participants include firefighter Diana Woolf, who will race the run portion of IRONMAN 70.3 Santa Rosa in her full fire gear as she raises money and awareness for the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation and her personal campaign, Rescue4PTSD.</p>
<p>IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors Shannon Spake, NASCAR correspondent and Fox Sports sideline reporter, and former Marine Mike Ergo will also participate. Ergo will race IRONMAN 70.3 Santa Rosa completing the run portion while carrying the American flag to honor Army Pfc. &nbsp;Cesar Viglienzone, a Santa Rosa native killed in action in Baghdad on February 1, 2006. This initiative is in partnership with Flags4Fallen, a volunteer team that recruits athletes to carry USA Flags to the finish line for Gold Star families who have lost a loved one in the line of duty.</p>
<p>On Friday, July 27, The IRONMAN Foundation will host a First Responders Reception at Perch + Plow to honor local men and women who bravely fought the wildfires and continue to ensure the safety of the Santa Rosa residents.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community 5k will be held on Sunday, July 29 at 8:00AM at Old Courthouse Square. Proceeds from this event will go directly to the Santa Rosa Parks Foundation to provide assistance as they work to rebuild local parks that were affected by the wildfires.</p>
<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners like HOKA ONE ONE, the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and CLIF Bar, we hope to be able to make a difference in Santa Rosa’s continued recovery from the wildfires,” said Sarah Hartmann, IRONMAN Foundation Acting Executive Director. “It will be a highlight to honor local first responders, to run the Community 5k on Sunday morning and support the restoration of Santa Rosa’s parks and later provide hands-on rebuilding assistance with Rebuilding Together Petaluma.”</p>

Presented by HOKA ONE ONE and in partnership with Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, the IRONMAN Foundation will be conducting a hands-on service project with Rebuilding Together Petaluma to assist in the construction of “tiny houses” for Santa Rosa residents who continue to be displaced by the Tubbs Wildfires that ripped through the region last October. The service project will take place on Sunday, July 29 at 10:00 a.m. and bring together IRONMAN staff, athletes, ambassadors and partners as well as employees from HOKA ONE ONE and CLIF Bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rebuilding Together Petaluma is thrilled to have the support of the IRONMAN Foundation and IRONMAN volunteers to construct new homes for fire survivors,” said Jane Hamilton, Executive Director of Rebuilding Together Petaluma. “This gives our fire recovery work a significant boost towards success.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HOKA ONE ONE is honored to be able to support IRONMAN, the IRONMAN Foundation, and the process of rebuilding together,” said Wendy Yang, President of HOKA ONE ONE. “Our connection to the IRONMAN community, especially in our home state of California, goes well beyond the race itself, and it is humbling to see everyone come together to provide relief to our neighbors and friends.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighted service project volunteers include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Three-time IRONMAN World Champion triathlete <strong>Mirinda Carfrae</strong> and her husband and fellow professional triathlete, <strong>Timothy O’Donnell</strong>, multiple IRONMAN World Championship top-ten finisher. Both are also IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>



<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners like HOKA ONE ONE, the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and CLIF Bar, we hope to be able to make a difference in Santa Rosa’s continued recovery from the wildfires,” said Sarah Hartmann, Acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “It will be a highlight to honor local first responders, to run the Community 5k on Sunday morning and support the restoration of Santa Rosa’s parks and later provide hands-on rebuilding assistance with Rebuilding Together Petaluma.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To kick-off event weekend, the IRONMAN Foundation will host a First Responders Reception at Perch + Plow on Friday, July 27 to honor local men and women who bravely fought the wildfires and continue to ensure the safety of the Santa Rosa residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also taking place this week will be an IRONMAN Foundation Community 5K scheduled for Sunday, July 29 at 8:00 a.m. at the Old Courthouse Square. Proceeds from this event will go directly to the Santa Rosa Parks Foundation to provide assistance as they work to rebuild local parks that were affected by the wildfires. This year, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute a total of $111,000<em> </em>in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the Santa Rosa region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was founded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when Firehouse Subs Founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, traveled to Mississippi where they provided food to first responders and survivors. As they traveled back to Florida, they knew they could do more and Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was born with the mission of providing funding, life-saving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety organizations. Since its inception, the non-profit organization has granted more than $35 million to hometown heroes in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To celebrate the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the event, the IRONMAN Foundation will host a special “20 Years of Lake Placid” reception to honor the event’s founders and key stakeholders. Notable attendees include Graham Fraser, a pioneer who put IRONMAN events on the map in North America, two-time IRONMAN Lake Placid Champion, IRONMAN World Champion and IRONMAN Hall of Famer Heather Fuhr, and New York City Firefighter Matt Long. In 2005, Long was struck by a 20-ton bus as it was making an illegal turn. After more than five months in the hospital and 40 operations, he finished IRONMAN Lake Placid in 2009. A silent auction will showcase entries into select IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup> events, hotel stays, VIP packages and various commemorative items.

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will partner with the Lake Placid Outing Club to host a water safety and stand-up paddle boarding clinic for local youth on Thursday, July 19 at 9AM at Mirror Lake as part of IRONMAN Lake Placid race week. The service project will conclude with a paddle-board race for the children as they put their newly acquired skills to the test. The Lake Placid Outing Club will be presented with 10 mountain bikes through the Bike for a Kid program, as well as a $4,000 Community Grant to be used to support their mission in empowering youth through wilderness activities.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have the opportunity to work with the IRONMAN Foundation on this community service project,” said Dave Balestrini, Chairman of the Board at Lake Placid Outing Club. “Local kids will greatly enjoy and learn from this experience. The Lake Placid Outing Club is also grateful for the continued support of the IRONMAN Foundation as it allows us to reach more youth in our community and expand the experiences that we are able to offer them.”</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will partner with Paradox Sports to host an adaptive rock climbing clinic for visually impaired athletes. Paradox Sports, a non-profit organization based in Boulder, Colorado provides youth, adults and military veterans with physical disabilities the opportunity to get outside. The service project taking place on Friday, June 8 at Boulder Rock Club will bring together Paradox Sports, IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors, and IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> athletes and volunteers. Paradox Sports will introduce nine visually impaired athletes and IRONMAN athlete volunteers to the sport of adaptive climbing, providing hands-on experience climbing and guiding.</p>
<p>In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $60,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the Boulder region in conjunction with the 2018 IRONMAN Boulder triathlon taking place on Sunday, June 10.</p>
<p>“Indoor climbing has exploded in popularity. Yet, climbing is still not accessible to everyone,” said Mike Neustedter, Executive Director of Paradox Sports. “We are excited to work with the IRONMAN Foundation to offer a group of people with visual impairments an equal opportunity to participate in a sport that so many athletes love.”</p>
<p>Volunteers participating in the June 8 service project with Paradox Sports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott Leason, a Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) triathlete, surfer and water-skier. Scott lost his sight in 1993 when he was shot in the head during a convenience store robbery. The bullet missed Scott’s brain but resulted in the loss of both of his eyes and his sense of smell. He has competed in multiple IRONMAN races and was the only visually impaired athlete on Team USA at the ISA World Adaptive Surfing Championship presented by CAF.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Jackie Faye, the first woman to race six IRONMAN events on six continents in one year.

<p>“It’s an honor and privilege to support so many Boulder community organizations and their incredible work,” said Sarah Hartmann, acting Executive Director for the IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact here in Boulder. It will be a highlight to meet the Paradox Sports athletes at the service project, introduce them to our IRONMAN athletes and witness their inspiring resolve.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $586,000 in the region since the first event in Boulder. In 2018 the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.7 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will launch its 2018 pop-up service project, “Bike for a Kid” presented by FLO Cycling at IRONMAN Santa Rosa. On Wednesday and Thursday, May 9 and 10 from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day, IRONMAN staff, athletes and community members will converge inside IRONMAN Village to build 50 youth bikes that will be donated to local military families stationed at Travis Air Force Base through a partnership with Blue Star Families.</p>
<p>“We are honored to have the opportunity to give back to communities like Santa Rosa that do so much to support IRONMAN,” said Chris Thornham, owner and co-founder of FLO Cycling. “We are elated to donate 50 bikes to 50 wonderful children and owe thanks to the IRONMAN Foundation and Blue Star Families for helping make this possible.”</p>
<p>“Military children serve alongside their parents and making the connections to support and celebrate them is at the heart of the Blue Star Families mission,” said Noeleen Tillman, Chief Operating Officer of Blue Star Families. “Partnerships like these where we come together to build community between the civilian community and our military families are invaluable. IRONMAN Foundation, FLO Cycling, and all the other volunteers are our Blue Star Neighbors.”</p>

<p>As part of the Humanitarian Relief Effort to support recovery from the Tubbs wildfire of 2017, the IRONMAN Foundation will return to the Santa Rosa area on Sunday, July 29, following the IRONMAN 70.3 Santa Rosa triathlon for a rebuilding service project. Volunteers that are interested in being a part of the rebuilding efforts, are able to sign up for the service project online and at Courthouse Square in IRONMAN Village during the “Bike for a Kid” project at this weekend’s IRONMAN Santa Rosa event.</p>
<p>“We are truly honored to support so many local organizations in assisting with the community’s wildfire recovery and to also have the opportunity to provide support for local Gold Star and Blue Star families,” said Sarah Hartmann, Acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “We invite our entire IRONMAN community to stop by the IRONMAN Foundation booth at Courthouse Square, build a Bike for a Kid and sign up to volunteer for the wildfire rebuilding project set for July 29. Together we can leave a lasting and tangible impact here in Santa Rosa.

<p>Continuing the support of military members and their families, Marine Corps veteran and IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Mike Ergo will engage with Flags4Fallen, which is a volunteer team that recruits athletes to carry a full-sized U.S. Flag to the finish line for families who have lost a loved one too soon. Ergo, who completed two l tours in Iraq, including the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004 has used triathlon to battle the demons of PTSD while finding a way to keep alive the memory of his 29 fallen battalion brothers. Through this initiative, Ergo will be keeping the memory of another fallen soldier alive as he carries an American flag throughout the marathon course in honor of U.S. Army Cpl. Josh Kynoch, a Santa Rosa native who was killed in action in Iraq on October 1, 2005. Cpl.

<p>As IRONMAN celebrates its 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, Ergo was selected as a “40 Years of Dreams” ambassador and will share his personal IRONMAN journey at the IRONMAN Santa Rosa Welcome Ceremony taking place on Thursday at 6 p.m. in Courthouse Square. Ergo’s vision is to see Gold Star families honored at IRONMAN events around the country by having veterans carry flags in honor of fallen service members and reconnecting Gold Star families with their communities. “Gold Star families are often forgotten, because we feel uncomfortable and don’t know what to say,” said Ergo. “But for us to truly heal the emotional wounds of war, we need them as much as they need us.”</p>

On Thursday morning, 30 volunteers made up of IRONMAN athletes, family and IRONMAN Foundation Staff were welcomed into the homes of Ms. Dorothy and Mr. Ronald. Together they applied a fresh coat of paint on the exterior of Ms. Dorothy’s home and on inside of Mr. Ronald’s home. In addition, $35,000 was awarded to Rebuilding Together Houston, as they continue rebuilding homes in the Houston area post Hurricane Harvey.</span>

The IRONMAN Foundation Athletes breezed through the swim, but as they transitioned to the bike, the infamous Texas heat sweltered and challenged them. It got even hotter as they moved from the bike to the run, and our Athletes had to push their limits all the way to the IRONMAN finish line, proving that “Anything is Possible” when you Race For More. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</span>

<p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(April 23, 2018) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> announced today the 2018 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team and the creation of the Mālama Club. In celebration of IRONMAN’s 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, the IRONMAN Foundation has expanded its ambassador program by launching the Mālama Club, a team of 14 IRONMAN athletes who are ardent supporters of the IRONMAN Foundation’s mission of creating positive, tangible change in race communities and embody the spirit of the Hawaiian word Mālama, meaning to “take care of, preserve and protect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The supporting 2018 IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team is comprised of 22 carefully selected members: 19 age-group athletes; Team Captain, the “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly; and pro triathletes Mirinda Carfrae, a three-time IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> World Champion, and Timothy O’Donnell, a multi-year IRONMAN World Championship top-ten finisher. Ambassadors have been chosen for their outstanding involvement in their own communities and will continue to exemplify what it means to ‘Race for More’ by focusing their efforts on the IRONMAN Foundation’s 16 service projects this season. In 2017, the IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador team supported 14 service projects and contributed to the IRONMAN Foundation’s $1.5 million total in grant funding to 1,380 organizations in IRONMAN race communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Having the honor of representing the IRONMAN Foundation last year as the Ambassador Captain was one of the highlights of my career,” said Reilly. “To be able to give back and help those in need throughout our IRONMAN communities is very gratifying and needed. I am looking forward to continuing that role in 2018 and hope others consider being a part of the IRONMAN Foundation team this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Age-group athlete ambassadors include Shannon Spake, Mike Ergo and Derek Fitzgerald. Shannon Spake is a multiple IRONMAN 70.3 finisher and a veteran sports broadcaster with FOX Sports covering NASCAR, college basketball, college football and the NFL. In 2017, she was named co-host of FS1’s daily NASCAR news and highlights program “NASCAR RACE HUB,” while continuing to host NASCAR RACEDAY-XFINITY live from the track preceding each weekend’s NASCAR XFINITY SERIES race. Most recently, Spake voiced the role of “Shannon Spokes” in Disney Pixar’s Cars 3. Despite being diagnosed with scoliosis as a child and undergoing back surgery at thirteen, she swam competitively through high school and college and has been committed to staying active ever since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Ergo is a Marine Corps veteran who completed several tours in Iraq. He took part in the heavy urban combat during the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. While there, 29 of his battalion brothers lost their lives. Once he got back to the United States, Mike self-medicated to numb the pain. After he was diagnosed with PTSD, Mike used triathlon as a recovery tool. During each event, Mike wears the names of his fallen Marine Corps brothers on his race kit and dedicates the races to their memory and families. Last year, he competed in the IRONMAN World Championship as an IRONMAN Ambassador Athlete for his commitment to helping his fellow veterans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 40-years-old, Derek Fitzgerald became the first American heart transplant recipient to complete a full-distance IRONMAN race. Before that, he spent a decade battling cancer and heart failure as he suffered from Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. After his first IRONMAN 70.3 triathlon, he co-founded the Tin Man Endurance Team comprised exclusively of heart transplant recipients. He also created a new foundation called The Recycledman Foundation whose mission is to educate and inspire supporters of advancements in cancer research, heart health, and organ donation. As an entrepreneur and technologist, Derek has spent the last 15+ years creating successful tech companies that specialize in building solutions for pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the Mālama Club include Marcus Cook. Last May, Marcus was down 250 pounds from the 500 pounds he weighed just two years earlier. Cook started his journey by walking 20 minutes a day, and eventually moved up to a sprint triathlon. He then completed IRONMAN Texas in April with his sights on the 2018 IRONMAN World Championship, all with the goal of raising money for the IRONMAN Foundation. The 45-year-old oil and gas executive continues to find ways to use his story to impact those he knows and those he hasn’t met yet. In pursuit of this, he has increased his original fundraising goal for the IRONMAN Foundation from $40,000 to $100,000 this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an extraordinary moment when an IRONMAN athlete has the opportunity to connect directly with the cause they support and make a difference in their race community,” said Sarah Hartmann, acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “Our 2018 Ambassador and Mālama Club athletes truly embody our mantra of ‘Service Through Sport and Commitment to Community,’ and we are deeply grateful for their service and support.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation® creates positive, tangible change in IRONMAN race communities by engaging athletes and volunteers to participate in programs that demonstrate service through sport and commitment to community. Since 2003, over $50,000,000 has been provided through IRONMAN charitable giveback programs including the IRONMAN Foundation to more than 6,300 local, regional, national and global nonprofit initiatives.

The grant will help restore the homes of two seniors, Ms. Dorothy and Mr. Ronald, who live in Harris County and were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. The grant will also provide athletes with the opportunity to help restore their homes during a service project on April 26. Collectively, they will complete exterior work on Ms. Dorothy’s home and interior work on Mr. Ronald’s home. In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $140,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Harris County and Montgomery County regions in conjunction with the 2018 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> North American Championship Texas triathlon taking place on Saturday, April 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hurricane Harvey devastated families across the greater Houston area; the recovery here will take years,” said Christine Holland, CEO and Executive Director of Rebuilding Together Houston. “We’re very thankful for the partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation—this year’s gift will help give two families stability and get them back into their homes to start rebuilding their lives.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Hurricane Harvey’s record flood waters devastated much of Southeast Texas, the IRONMAN community stepped up to support the IRONMAN Foundation’s Humanitarian Relief Effort campaign. In addition to Rebuilding Together Houston, Interfaith of The Woodlands will receive a $10,000 grant – $5,000 will support their ongoing Harvey recovery efforts in Montgomery County and $5,000 will support their mission-based projects, including the Interfaith Food Pantry Assistance Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven additional local non-profit organizations will receive Community Grant awards during race week of the Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Texas triathlon. They include Angel Reach, Boy Scouts of America Troop 491, Education for Tomorrow Alliance, Meals on Wheels Montgomery County, Montgomery County Amateur Radio Emergency Service, Magnolia ISD and Boy Scouts of America Troop 1042.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN and IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $960,000 in the region since the first event in The Woodlands. In 2018, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.7 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a privilege to support so many incredible local community organizations and to continue assisting with the community’s Hurricane Harvey recovery,” said Sarah Hartmann, acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact here in Southeast Texas. It will be a highlight to meet Ms. Dorothy and Mr. Ronald at the service project, introduce them to our IRONMAN athletes and welcome them back home.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The week started with a Team IMF Shake It Out Run and breakfast at Petite Madeline Bakery to celebrate the team’s fundraising efforts.  Team IMF bonded and was welcomed by surprised guests, IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team Captain and the “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly, and the Acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation, Sarah Hartmann.  Together, 10 Team IMF Athletes at IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside raised $19,000 dollars, bringing the overall giveback to the Oceanside community to $33,000 in 2018. The team was pumped and eager to toe the start line the next morning and were ready to dedicate their races to their race community. Their incredible impact will be left long after race day.</p>

<p>As race day flew by, so did our Team IMF Athletes. Race day conditions could not have been anything shy of perfection. The water conditions were smooth as glass; the bike and run courses were welcoming with a beautiful breeze coming off of the ocean. After all Team IMF members had crossed the red carpeted IROMAN finish line, it was time to recover and prep for the amazing day they had ahead of them— our service project day.</p>

<p>More than 50 athletes returned to the IRONMAN finish line on Sunday morning to start what would be a great day of changing lives. In partnership with the Junior Seau Foundation and the Challenged Athletes Foundation, 30 youth, women and men with physical challenges learned how to surf with the help and support of the amazing IRONMAN Foundation Volunteers . It was a day filled with smiles, laughter and a few happy tears as Volunteers, participants and spectators were impacted. Four IRONMAN Pro Athletes jumped in and assisted with spotting our surfers, including second year participant and IRONMAN World Champion Lionel Sanders.</p>

Thank you, IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside, for a memorable 2018 race week. We look forward to returning in 2019 and continuing to leave a tangible impact on this race community!</p>

Grant funding will support the Buena Vibra Foundation’s ongoing roof reconstruction work, and on Monday, March 19, IRONMAN Foundation volunteers were transported to Barrio Ingenio for a Community Revitalization Volunteer Day. Working as teams in collaboration with community residents and leaders, we cleared debris, painted and cleaned several homes. Together we created a long-term, lasting impact and assisted with the emotional revitalization of the community by turning their post-hurricane shelters back into a vibrant community of homes.

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will hold its second service project of the 2018 season with an adaptive surf clinic that will include specialized sessions for youth, women and military/adults with physical challenges as part of the Junior Seau Foundation Adaptive Youth Surf Program presented by Challenged Athletes Foundation, taking place on Sunday, April 8, 2018. In addition, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute over $33,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Oceanside, California community in conjunction with the 2018 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Oceanside triathlon taking place on Saturday, April 7.</p>
<p>The clinic will host three specialized sessions that will total up to 30 kids, women and military/adults with physical challenges who will spend the morning learning to paddle and surf at Oceanside Pier with the assistance of volunteers including professional and age-group triathletes and coaches. The Junior Seau Foundation Adaptive Surf Program presented by Challenge Athletes Foundation provides the opportunity for participants with physical challenges to learn how to surf, improve their skills and ultimately share in a lifestyle sport that so many in Southern California enjoy, while celebrating the legacy of Junior Seau, the former San Diego Chargers linebacker who lived in Oceanside and surfed regularly.</p>
<p>“We are very grateful to the Junior Seau Foundation, the IRONMAN Foundation and all the athletes who will come out to help advance our program to teach and develop the next wave of challenged athletes in Adaptive Surfing,” said Virginia Tinley, CAF Executive Director. “This clinic offers everyone that participates in a truly special and life-changing opportunity to make an impact in this community. We are excited to see some of these attendees catch their first waves and stand on their surfboards for the first time.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where North American IRONMAN events are held. In 2018, the IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.7 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America, including a grant program to support organizations with a volunteerism component.</p>
<p>“We are honored to support so many outstanding local community organizations and for our ongoing partnership with Challenged Athletes Foundation,” said Sarah Hartmann, Acting Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “The adaptive surf clinic is an extraordinary opportunity for our athletes to connect with CAF heroes and create a lasting and tangible impact in Oceanside.”<br>

The support includes a large-scale service project in partnership with the Buena Vibra Foundation, where 125 athletes and volunteers on March 19 will help restore homes and revitalize the community of Barrio Ingenio in Toa Baja.</p>
<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes and partners, we hope to be able to make a difference in Puerto Rico’s recovery,” said Joanna Jordan, Managing Director for IRONMAN in Latin America. “We look forward to welcoming athletes and volunteers who are traveling from around the world to ‘Race For Puerto Rico’ and provide hands-on rebuilding support the day after the race.”</p>
<p>“We are grateful and honored that the IRONMAN Foundation will work with Barrio Ingenio in Puerto Rico for their volunteer efforts right after the IRONMAN 70.3 race,” said Max Pérez, Vice-President of Buena Vibra Group and Vice-President of Buena Vibra Foundation. “It shows the strong commitment the organization and volunteers have in investing and giving back to the locations which host their events.

<p>We started off our race week off with “The Athlete In You, A Proud Tradition”, a service project, in which we hosted a variety of workshops including nutrition, yoga and a athlete panel discussion, at the Salt River High School located in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. We also hosted our “We’ve Got Your Back(pack)” mini service project in IRONMAN Village on Friday and Saturday leading up to race day, where IRONMAN athletes stuffed over 150 backpacks for the students of Salt River Elementary school. Thanks to the support of 245 IRONMAN Foundation athletes, we were able to distribute more than $65,000 in giveback to nonprofit groups and initiatives in the greater Tempe area, including a $10,0000 Community Grant to the Salt River Children’s Foundation!</p>
<p>With this being the last race of the 2017 IRONMAN season, your team behind the team here at IMF would love to hug you all individually, however, since that would take a lot of airline miles, we would just like to say many thanks to all of our IRONMAN Foundation athletes who made the commitment to dedicate their race(s) to #RaceForMore this year. The impact we’ve left behind this year in all of our race communities could not be possible without you, and for that, we thank you! We are looking forward to an amazing 2018 and hope you join us for another year of leaving our impact(s) long after race day(s)!</p>

<p>Leading up to the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Arizona triathlon on November 19, the IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute more than $65,000 to non-profit groups and initiatives, as well as facilitate tribal youth workshops in the greater Tempe and Scottsdale areas.</p>
<p>The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community will host IRONMAN athletes at Salt River High School for student workshops under the theme “The Athlete In You, A Proud Tradition.” SRHS students in grades 7-12 will participate in fitness and nutrition workshops with local IRONMAN athletes from Salt River, as well as IRONMAN athletes from around the world. Students will learn from the experts in athletic preparation, yoga and meditation, as well as healthy eating, including an “athlete fuel” lunch.</p>
<p>“We’re excited by the opportunity to not only have our students learn from some of the most dedicated athletes in the world and in our community, but to also have students make the connection that prioritizing health and wellness honors their O’odham and Piipaash heritage,” said SRHS Assistant Principal Rob Barnes.</p>
<p>Students at Salt River Elementary School won’t be left out. Continuing the “We’ve Got Your Back(pack)” program launched in April of this year, volunteers at the IRONMAN Foundation booth inside the IRONMAN Village will also prepare backpacks for the elementary students. Backpacks provided by Travelway Group International will include school supplies and sunscreen provided by Walmart, water bottles from Gatorade, healthy snacks from Clif Bar and inspirational notes written by IRONMAN athletes competing in IRONMAN Arizona.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Salt River Community Children’s Foundation will receive a $10,000 Community Grant from the IRONMAN Foundation.</p>
<p>“We are very grateful for an IRONMAN Foundation grant,” said Robert Scabby, Chairman of the Salt River Community Children’s Foundation Board.  “By leveraging the funding and multiplying the opportunities it opens up, we are able to extend helping hands and lift our tribal children to see clearer, richer vistas in their future lives.”</p>
<p>“We are extremely honored for the invitation from the Salt River Community to spend the morning with the Salt River High School students, to support the Salt River Community Children’s Foundation and the Salt River Elementary School,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “This is an extraordinary experience and together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact in the community.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $845,000 in the Tempe region. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation® will provide youth backpacks and a $3,000 grant sponsored Boardwalk Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Convention Center to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Bay County for Pan-Florida Challenge Power Packs to feed hungry children enrolled in their after school programs. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $48,000 in grant funding to nonprofit groups and initiatives in the greater Panama City Beach area in conjunction with the 2017 IRONMAN Florida triathlon taking place on Saturday, November 4.</p>
<p>Continuing the <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/weve-got-backpack/">“We’ve Got Your Back(pack)”</a> program launched in April of this year, volunteers at the IRONMAN Foundation booth inside the IRONMAN Village will prepare backpacks for local children in need. Backpacks provided by Travelway Group International will include school supplies and sunscreen provided by Walmart, water bottles from Gatorade, healthy snacks from Clif Bar and inspirational notes written by IRONMAN athletes. The backpacks will be presented to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Bay County.</p>
<p>“We are excited about this new partnership and what it means for our club kids,” said Hank Hill, Chief Executive Office of Boys &amp; Girls Club Bay County. “Many of our club kids come from either single parent homes, or homes where they receive free or reduced lunches in schools. This program will extend help over the weekend when the kids may really need it the most.”</p>
<p>Through the generosity of Boardwalk Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Convention Center, Pan-Florida Challenge (PFC) will use their $3,000 grant to provide 600 PFC Power Packs to hungry children enrolled in the after school programs at the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Bay County. PFC Power Packs contain 13 kid-friendly, nutritious, shelf-stable meals that meet or exceed the USDA recommendations for calories, carbohydrates, and protein for kids. The PFC Power Packs will feed 150 children over the weekends for four weeks.</p>
<p>“Childhood hunger is an under appreciated tragedy in the United States today. One in four children go hungry in Bay County. Pan-Florida Challenge is delighted and humbled to be working with IRONMAN Foundation, Boardwalk Beach Resort, and the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bay County to help these kids in need,” said Jeri Goetz, Executive Director of the Pan-Florida Challenge.</p>
<p>“As a long-standing supporter of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bay County, Boardwalk Beach Resort is honored to help feed children in our community,” said Mike Greer, Vice President of Royal American Hospitality. “We are thankful to The IRONMAN Foundation for recognizing the need for nutritious meals and snacks and their organization of this initiative.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $650,000 in the Panama City Beach region. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor and privilege to support so many Panama City Beach community organizations and their incredible work,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact. We are especially grateful for the opportunity to partner with Boardwalk Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Convention Center and Pan Florida Challenge to support the children served by Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Bay County. On behalf of all our IRONMAN athletes, we want the kids to know that we’ve got your back!”</p>

Prior to the start line, 9 TEAM IMF teammates came together for our breakfast at The Blue Plate on Saturday morning, where not only did the “Voice of IRONMAN”, Mike Reilly made an appearance, but as did one of the IRONMAN Foundation Community Grant recipients “On My Own 2 Feet”—a non-profit whose mission is to channel the commitment and discipline received in training runs to other life activities such as obtaining independence, a job and ultimately housing for the homeless community in Chattanooga. “On My Own 2 Feet” personally thanked our TEAM IMF Athletes for their fundraising efforts and for not only making an impact on their own organization, but for leaving their legacy on the IRONMAN Chattanooga community long after race day regardless of their race results.</p>
<p>Thanks to these athletes and to our IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund athletes, our total give back to the IRONMAN Chattanooga race community was over $126,000.00 for 2017 between all three races—IRONMAN 70.3 Chattanooga, IRONMAN 70.3 Worlds and IRONMAN Chattanooga. Historically, this brings our total give back total up to $351,500.00! The IRONMAN Foundation has spent a lot of time in the IRONMAN Chattanooga race community this year and is thoroughly looking forward the impact we have the honor of leaving in 2018.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will partner with My Own 2 Feet &amp; Wheels, a running, walking and biking program created to support and motivate the Chattanooga homeless community with a Community Grant to purchase new bikes and running equipment. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $50,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the Chattanooga region in conjunction with the 2017 Little Debbie IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Chattanooga triathlon presented by McKee A Family Bakery taking place on Sunday, September 24. The IRONMAN Foundation’s overall giveback in Chattanooga in 2017 will be $126,500, bringing the total awarded to-date to $351,500.</p>
<p>“Robert Gustafson and I are excited beyond words to receive this funding from The IRONMAN Foundation,” said Rita Fanning, Co-Manager of My Own 2 Feet &amp; Wheels. “With this grant, our participants will receive new bicycles, helmets, bike locks and shoes and it will allow us to continue our running/walking program. We have been elated with the program’s success and have found that participants gained self-confidence, a healthy lifestyle and self-sufficiency.”</p>
<p>In addition, a Community Grant will also be awarded to the Ridgeland High School JROTC in Rossville, Georgia. The grant will provide new equipment and support their program to develop citizens of character dedicated to serving their country and community. Both grants will be awarded at the Welcome Ceremony on Friday, September 22 at 6:00 p.m. at Ross’s Landing.</p>
<p>“We are truly honored to partner with My Own 2 Feet &amp; Wheels, the Ridgeland High School JROTC and to support so many local community organizations and their incredible initiatives,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we’re creating a tangible and lasting impact in the Chattanooga region.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>

Thanks to TEAM IMF and their fabulous donors, the IRONMAN Foundation delivered over 150 backpacks on race weekend and presented them to the school’s principal. Between IRONMAN Lake Placid and IRONMAN 70.3 Lake Placid TEAM IMF members, our total give back to the Lake Placid race community was over $90,000, which brings the historical give back to the community over $1.5 million dollars historically! We’re excited to return to this beautiful race community next year to join in the celebration of IRONMAN Lake Placid’s 20th anniversary as we continue to #RaceForMore.</p>

                                                                                    <em>Funds raised through donations and custom Humanitarian T-shirt sales to support local recovery efforts and service projects</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
                                                                                      <strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (August 30, 2017) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> has launched a Harvey Relief Effort campaign to raise critical funds in response to the catastrophic and ongoing severe weather and flooding in Texas. Funds raised will support recovery efforts and service projects in the greater race communities for the Memorial Hermann IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> North American Championship Texas, Memorial Hermann IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Texas and Humana Rock ‘n’ Roll San Antonio Marathon &amp; ½ Marathon<sup>®</sup>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With record floodwaters devastating much of southeast Texas, tens of thousands of people will seek emergency shelter and more than 450,000 will seek federal aid in recovering from Harvey. When the Category 4 hurricane made landfall, it was the most powerful to hit the United States in a decade. Officials have called the catastrophic flooding the worst in the state’s history. Thousands have been rescued from flooded homes and cars and recovery will take years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help raise funds for those in need, the IRONMAN Foundation has set up three ways to help with the Harvey Relief Effort:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
                                                                                        <strong>DONATE</strong> – The IRONMAN Foundation will match all donations made by September 30, 2017, up to $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>
                                                                                          <strong>T-SHIRT SALES</strong> – 100% of the proceeds raised through the sale of a custom Humanitarian Harvey Relief T-Shirt will go towards the IRONMAN Foundation’s Harvey Relief Efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
                                                                                            <strong>VOLUNTEER</strong> – The IRONMAN Foundation will be setting up local service projects during race week at the Humana Rock ‘n’ Roll San Antonio Marathon &amp; ½ Marathon, Memorial Hermann IRONMAN 70.3 Texas triathlon, and Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Championship Texas triathlon to provide hands-on rebuilding assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>“We are calling upon our IRONMAN and Rock ‘n’ Roll communities to join us in helping to bring relief to these communities in a historic time of need,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director for The IRONMAN Foundation. “The areas affected will require ongoing assistance and both donations now and volunteer efforts down the road are critically important for relief and recovery efforts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pledges and t-shirt purchases may be made online or at all IRONMAN, IRONMAN 70.3 and Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series event merchandise stores during September.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Coeur d’Alene Recreation Department will use their Community Grant to support multiple recreation and fitness activities in Kootenai County, including Specialized Needs Recreation. The Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Center will use their grant to fund the “Third Grade Learn to Swim Program,” where for eight years, thousands of local children learn to swim annually. Grant funding will support multiple initiatives for the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Kootenai County, Kootenai Health Foundation and North Idaho College Foundation.</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> events are held. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to support so many local community organizations and their incredible initiatives,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a long-lasting and tangible impact here in Idaho.”</p>

            <strong>IRONMAN LAKE PLACID| WE’VE GOT THE BEAT!</strong>
            </p>
<p>You could not have drawn up a more perfect day for the 19<sup>th</sup> IRONMAN Lake Placid race. 7 Team IMF Athletes showed up to dominate one of the oldest, the most beautiful and the most difficult race courses on the IRONMAN circuit. The week kicked-off with The IRONMAN Foundation® hosting a large-scale Hands-Only CPR training event for the community of Lake Placid, IRONMAN athletes and for their families and friends. This is the first time that the Foundation has hosted their service project in IRONMAN Village and it was a huge success! By training over 700 people, The IRONMAN Foundation and The American Red Cross helped increased the survival rate of victims that go into cardiac arrest by double and/or triple the rate if assisted by a bystander utilizing their Hands-Only CPR training! The IRONMAN Foundation also celebrated the distribution of more the $90,000 in total charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Lake Placid region in conjunction with the 2017 IRONMAN® Lake Placid triathlon during the Welcome Ceremony Friday evening. Saturday morning, Team IMF Athletes, Team IMF Ambassadors, the IRONMAN Foundation staff and the voice of IRONMAN, Mike Riley, enjoyed breakfast together celebrating the success of their fundraising efforts while overlooking the beautiful Mirror Lake as they geared up for race day. We are looking forward to returning to Lake Placid in September for the inaugural IRONMAN 70.3 Lake Placid race!  #RaceForMore</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will host a large-scale Hands-Only CPR training for the community of Lake Placid, for IRONMAN athletes, and for their families and friends, on July 20, 21 and 22 at IRONMAN Village located inside the Olympic Oval as part of IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Lake Placid race week. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will award a $5,000 Community Grant to the American Red Cross Eastern New York Region to support its training programs. The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $90,000 in total charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Lake Placid region in conjunction with the 2017 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Lake Placid triathlon taking place on Sunday, July 23.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be able to partner with the IRONMAN Foundation to bring lifesaving training to thousands of people during IRONMAN Lake Placid race week,” said Jane Gendron, Executive Director of the American Red Cross North Country Chapter, which serves the community of Lake Placid. “This is a unique opportunity and we are very grateful to the IRONMAN Foundation and our many dedicated volunteers for helping to make it possible.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total historical giveback to more than $1.5 million in the region. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>In addition to the American Red Cross, two local non-profit organizations will receive Community Grant awards, the Lake Placid Outing Club and the Mirror Lake Watershed Association. Grants will be awarded at the Welcome Ceremony on Friday, July 21 and will include a special grant to Adirondack Health’s Stafford New Life Center. IRONMAN athlete Ryan Heisler raised the funds for the special grant as part of the IRONMAN Foundation’s “Your Journey, Your Cause Program” and in memory of his infant son, Owen.</p>
<p>“As both an organization and as individuals, we are incredibly moved by Ryan’s support for our Stafford New Life Center,” said Sylvia Getman, Adirondack Health President &amp; CEO. “His generosity and compassion will touch hundreds of lives, and we are so very grateful to count Ryan as a friend. We wish him, and all of his fellow competitors, a safe and successful IRONMAN.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to support so many incredible local community organizations and causes,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a tangible and lasting impact in Lake Placid. It will be a highlight to meet members of the community, the athletes and their friends at the three-day Hands-Only CPR training, introduce them to our IRONMAN Foundation Ambassadors, including Team Captain and “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly and learn how to save a life!”</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will partner with <a href="http://www.paradoxsports.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox Sports</a> for a service project to fix erosion damage on the hiking trails of Eldorado Springs State Park followed by an adaptive rock climbing clinic. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $55,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the Boulder region in conjunction with the 2017 IRONMAN Boulder triathlon taking place on Sunday, June 11, bringing the total giveback to more than $525,000.</p>
<p>“The IRONMAN Foundation has been an absolute game-changer for our organization,” said Mike Neustedter, Executive Director of Paradox Sports. “We are best known for helping people with disabilities climb America’s most iconic peaks, but multi-year support by The IRONMAN Foundation has empowered us to make our backyard in beautiful Boulder more accessible for people with disabilities. Our community has been requesting more local services for years and we are now able to lead local participants up Boulder’s famous Flatirons and host rock climbing programs in both Boulder and Eldorado Canyons thanks to the support of The IRONMAN Foundation.”</p>
<p>The service project on Thursday, June 8 will bring together Paradox Sports and IRONMAN athletes, D3 Multisport TriClub and volunteers, including three-time IRONMAN World Champion Mirinda Carfrae and “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly – both members of the IRONMAN Foundation Ambassador Team.</p>
<p>
<strong>Rebecca and Dan are part of the Paradox Sports team. Here is their story. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rebecca-and-Dan.jpg">
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rebecca-and-Dan-1024x683.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>On March 20, 2011, Rebecca received a message that her twin brother, Dan, had been in a cycling accident and was in the trauma unit at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in critical condition. They weren’t sure he was going to make it. As Dan lay in a coma fighting for his life, a meeting with the doctor revealed the extent of nerve damage—a brachial plexus injury—resulting from the accident. Dan’s right arm, hand, and most of his right lung were paralyzed.</p>
<p>She broke down. She felt that she’d wake up soon from this nightmare. The reality, though, was that Dan continued to fight for his life and she began the process of ensuring Dan would have the best care possible if he could pull through.</p>
<p>After a month, Dan was stable enough to be transferred to Craig Hospital in Colorado, an incredible hospital specializing in brain and spinal cord injuries. After a couple of months at Craig, Dan moved in with Rebecca in Boulder, where she became his caregiver. Though he moved forward in his recovery slowly but surely, depression crept in—something so common with trauma. Their relationship became strained during that period of recovery, also very common when a family member is the caregiver.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, Dan learned of a local organization that creates physically adaptive sports communities, called Paradox Sports. Dan’s interest was piqued. When her brother found Paradox Sports he “found his people” as well as a new outlook on life. Once an avid cyclist, Dan was now compelled to find new hobbies. Through Paradox, he discovered his love for climbing. “And,” said Rebecca, “I finally saw a glimpse of the brother I once knew come back to life.”</p>
<p>Over time they repaired their relationship and formed a deeper bond than ever before. For their 33<sup>rd</sup> birthday, Dan considered going on a trip to climb the Grand Teton offered by Paradox Sports. Dan wasn’t sure if he could make it; Rebecca had no doubt that he could.</p>
<p>Dan went on the trip and successfully climbed the Grand. He was also part of the film that documented the trip, A Grand Pursuit. As a result of this trip, Dan now serves as an ambassador for Paradox, is a gear reviewer, and is pursuing a business degree. He has regained his passion for life. “If it wasn’t for Paradox I don’t think he would have found that passion as quickly or as fully. And without Paradox, I don’t think we would have the brother-sister bond we have regained.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Another day, and another IRONMAN 70.3 race in the books. 13 TEAM IMF Athletes showed up to crush the IRONMAN 70.3 Chattanooga course, and boy, did they! It was an amazing few days filled with Pontoon Boat Dedications with the Tennessee River Gorge Trust, TEAM IMF Celebration Breakfasts at Blue Plate, hot weather (and then nice weather on race day) and so much more. As one of the favorite venues on the IRONMAN Circuit, Chattanooga again did not dissapoint, and we are looking forward to going back twice more this year: The IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships, and IRONMAN Chattanooga. Chattanooga- We will see you soon!</p>

<em>Join IRONMAN and Charity Miles to support your community, by earning dollars with every step.</em>
</h2>
<p>Triathletes spend months preparing to toe the start line of an IRONMAN race. During their training, they log many miles to ensure peak performance ensues on race day. The IRONMAN Foundation now has a way to make those miles count for more than just conditioning.</p>
<p>Together with the smart phone app Charity Miles, The IRONMAN Foundation is proud to offer athletes from all over the world the opportunity to give back to race communities by doing what they already do—train! For each mile logged in support of The IRONMAN Foundation, Charity Miles will donate money to the IMF Community Fund. This fund supports various vital athletic, community, education, health, human services and public benefit non-profit organizations in IRONMAN race communities in North America. Together we can turn your miles into positive, tangible community impact.</p>
<p>Since many athletes already carry phones during a workout—participating requires only one additional step. Simply activate the Charity Miles app before heading out to make each mile count. With racing season in full swing, most triathletes will be logging miles each and every day.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple. Before heading out on your next ride or run, follow these easy steps to start making your miles count today!</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Download the Charity Miles app</strong> from your iPhone or Android platform.</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Set up your account</strong> to begin logging miles.</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Before heading out for a run or a ride,</strong> open the Charity Miles app and select the IRONMAN Foundation as your charity of choice.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/FullSizeRender-169x300.jpg">
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Complete your workout </strong>with the Charity Miles app activated. Cyclists earn up to 10 cents per mile; runners/walkers earn up to 25 cents per mile.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1569-169x300.png">
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. At the end of your training</strong>, stop the app to complete the transaction and submit your mileage to the IRONMAN Foundation bank.</p>
<p>
<strong>6. Every time you run, walk, or bike</strong>, turn on Charity Miles. (Consistency is key!)</p>
<p>The average IRONMAN athlete while in peak training completes 280 miles total weekly, 7 miles of swimming, 225 of biking and 48 of running. The math is simple and the funds really can add up quickly to help to make a difference. At .10 cents per mile of biking, and at .25 cents per mile of running, that equals a donation to The IRONMAN Foundation of $34.50 per week.</p>
<p>Additionally, this app can be used for countless other activities, walking the dog, grocery shopping, going for a hike, a stroll in the park—every mile matters. According to Charity Miles, the average miles per user, is just 4 miles per use. Since the launch of Charity Miles, they have donated over $2 million to their charitable organizations in the app.</p>
<p>Without support of the communities, IRONMAN races could not happen. By donating miles to The IRONMAN Foundation, athletes now have a way to thank these communities for being part of their journey to the finish line. After all, becoming an IRONMAN is a life-changing experience, so why not help change lives in return?</p>

<strong>IRONMAN 70.3 SANTA ROSA | THAT’S A WRAP!</strong>
</p>
<p>It was a little windy in Santa Rosa, but there was plenty of sunshine (and wine!). Team IMF had an amazing time at IRONMAN 70.3 Santa Rosa giving back and racing hard. Together we left our IRONMAN legacy behind long after race day.</p>

</p>
<p>We kicked off race weekend with a Team IMF Breakfast at Brew in Santa Rosa. It was great to get our team of Team IMF Athletes, Women For Tri and Team IMF Ambassadors together before the big day! <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170512_102550.jpg">
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170512_102550-1024x768.jpg">
</a>Our group included IMF Pro Athlete Ambassador Mirinda “Rinny” Carfrae, who shared great race advice with the team. Her husband (and fellow Team IMF Pro Athlete Ambassador) Timothy O’Donnell have an “IRONKID” on the way.</p>

</p>
<p>Following the last Athlete Briefing, our two Women For Tri regional ambassadors Carla McKay and Brenda Bettencourt organized a meetup for women to talk race strategy and all things triathlon in IRONMAN Village. These women are from near and far (London!) and they are truly inspiring.</p>

<strong>IRONMAN Foundation Service Project</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>On Sunday after the race, athletes and volunteers traveled back to Lake Sonoma for a day of service with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Friends of Lake Sonoma. Following the historic flooding in the area earlier this year, our team helped restore hiking trails and camp grounds that are accessible only by boat.</p>

<p>And with that, we’re on to the next event! A huge thank you to all of the volunteers that came out to the IRONMAN Foundation Service Project, as well as all of the athletes that helped support their IRONMAN race community. Because of you, over $25,000 was granted to vital charities and non-profit organizations in the IRONMAN Santa Rosa region. Together we created real, tangible impact through sport. Together we #RaceForMore.</p>

<strong>
<em>The IRONMAN Foundation to provide $126,500 in charitable giveback to the greater Chattanooga region coinciding with three IRONMAN events hosted by Chattanooga in 2017</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will partner with the Tennessee River Gorge Trust to provide a new boat supporting the Trust’s ongoing mission to protect and provide open space, clean air and clean water to the 27,000-acre Gorge. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $35,500 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the Chattanooga region in conjunction with the 2017 Sunbelt Bakery IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Chattanooga triathlon taking place on Sunday, May 21. With three events being held in the area in 2017, the Sunbelt Bakery IRONMAN 70.3 Chattanooga, the Little Debbie IRONMAN Chattanooga and the 2017 IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship, the Foundation’s overall giveback will be $126,500, bringing the total awarded to date to $351,500.</p>

</p>
<p>“Partnering with the IRONMAN Foundation on this phenomenal boat will assist the Trust in furthering our mission, by allowing us to transport critical support equipment like our tractor and utility terrain vehicle deep into the river gorge and also allow us to logistically support important events like IRONMAN 70.3 now and in the future,” said Rick Huffines, Tennessee River Gorge Trust Executive Director. “The boat will also provide us with a water based platform to continue our educational, ecological and access oriented mission.  We are deeply grateful for this partnership and look forward to working with IRONMAN and supporting their endeavors in Chattanooga.  Healthy land and healthy people need each other.”</p>
<p>“We are truly honored to partner with the Tennessee River Gorge Trust and to support so many local community organizations and their incredible initiatives,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “The Trust has been protecting and providing clean air and clean water to the area since 1981 and, thanks to their dedication, it’s a gorgeous race community. How fitting that the new boat will be christened ‘GORGE’ous!”</p>

<em>Ambassadors to support service projects in eight IRONMAN North American race communities</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (May 8, 2017) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> today announced that the 2017 IMF Ambassador Team comprising 18 age-group triathletes from around the United States will be led by Team Captain and “Voice of IRONMAN” Mike Reilly as well as by pro triathletes Mirinda Carfrae, a three-time IRONMAN World Champion, and Timothy O’Donnell, a multi-year IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> World Championship top ten finisher. To support The Foundation’s mission to create tangible impact in IRONMAN race communities through philanthropy and volunteerism, the ambassadors will focus their efforts on The Foundation’s eight service projects in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each service project is conducted in partnership with a local nonprofit organization, powerfully linking IRONMAN athletes and TriClubs to the local race community. At the 2017 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Oceanside triathlon, an adaptive surf clinic for children with physical challenges was held with the Challenged Athletes Foundation. At the 2017 IRONMAN North American Championship Texas triathlon, a local disabled senior received a new roof and volunteers helped restore the exterior of her home with Rebuilding Together Houston.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an extraordinary moment when an IRONMAN athlete has the opportunity to connect directly with the cause they support and make a difference in their race community,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for the IRONMAN Foundation. “Our 2017 Team IMF Ambassador Team truly embodies our mantra of ‘Service Through Sport and Commitment to Community.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additional service projects include flood restoration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Friends of Lake Sonoma at IRONMAN 70.3 Santa Rosa, an adaptive climbing clinic and trail maintenance with Paradox Sports at IRONMAN Boulder, a race week hands-only CPR training with the American Red Cross at IRONMAN Lake Placid, and a day of service with the Salt River Children’s Foundation at IRONMAN Arizona. Two additional projects are planned for the 2017 IRONMAN World Championship and IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m extremely proud to represent the IRONMAN Foundation this season as the captain of the IMF Ambassador Team,” said Mike Reilly, Voice of IRONMAN. “This team has a unique opportunity to connect with our local race communities and give back through sport. The IRONMAN Foundation athletes give of themselves in order for others to achieve, there is no greater honor!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2017 Team IMF Ambassadors are:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Reilly, San Diego, CA&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mirinda Carfrae, Boulder, CO&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timothy O’Donnell, Boulder, CO&nbsp;</p>

<h2>IRONMAN TEXAS | THAT’S A WRAP!</h2>
<p>What a boot-scootin-boogie of a time we had down in the Great State of Texas for the first full U.S. IRONMAN event of the season: IRONMAN Texas! One thing you can always count on down in The Woodlands is, that you can’t ever count on the weather! Luckily for our IRONMAN Foundation Athletes, race day on Saturday ended up being an absolutely wonderful day. How could it not be, when at the end of the day, you get to come across an IRONMAN Finish Line with the knowledge that you have left your legacy in the IRONMAN Texas community far beyond race day?</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>A big shout-out to our TEAM IMF Athletes that raced this past weekend at IRONMAN Texas: Cedrick Dujon, John McGee, Aly Jacobs, &amp; Shaun Able. They raised over $16,000 in support of The IRONMAN Foundation and their IRONMAN race communities, and we are ever so grateful to have their incredible support.</p>

<strong>THE IRONMAN FOUNDATION TO RESTORE HOME FOR LOCAL SENIOR </strong>
<strong>WITH REBUILDING TOGETHER HOUSTON</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Service project part of $100,000 in charitable giveback at </em>
<em>2017 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Championship Texas</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will award a $10,000 Community Grant to Rebuilding Together Houston to restore the home of a local disabled senior known as Ms. Angela and provide athletes the opportunity to volunteer for a service project on April 19. Together they will band together to complete the exterior work on Ms. Angela’s home. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $100,000 in charitable giveback to nonprofit initiatives and groups in the greater Harris County and Montgomery County regions in conjunction with the 2017 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> North American Championship Texas triathlon taking place on Saturday, April 22.</p>
<p>“We are thankful to partner with The IRONMAN Foundation again this year,” said Jim Soller, Rebuilding Together Houston Executive Director. “These amazing athletes have put a tremendous amount of time into training and traveling to the race.  We are humbled by their additional efforts to support the Houston community with our home repair project.”</p>
<p>
<a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ms.-Angela-Collage.jpg">
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ms.-Angela-Collage-1024x576.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $820,000 in the region since the first event in The Woodlands. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>In addition to Rebuilding Together Houston, eight local non-profit organizations will receive Community Grant awards during IRONMAN Texas race week. They include Montgomery County Youth Services, Interfaith of the Woodlands, South County Football League, Education for Tomorrow Alliance, Boy Scouts of America Troop 491, Meals on Wheels Montgomery County, Montgomery County Amateur Radio Emergency Service and Let Them Drum.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the service project and grant funding, The IRONMAN Foundation will assemble backpacks filled with healthy snacks, a personal note from an IRONMAN athlete, and tools to inspire local students to eat well, exercise, and live a healthy lifestyle, giving athletes and their supporters the opportunity to connect to local youth and sending them the message that “We’ve got your back.” The backpacks will be presented to Montgomery County Youth Services, a 2017 Community Grant recipient that serves at-risk youth by providing crisis counseling, shelter programs and prevention services.</p>

</p>
<p>“It’s a privilege to support so many incredible local community organizations,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact here in Texas. It will be a highlight to meet Ms. Angela at the service project, introduce her to our IRONMAN athletes and TriClubs and welcome her home.”</p>

<em>2017 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Championship Texas</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla.</strong> (April 13, 2017) – The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will award a $10,000 Community Grant to Rebuilding Together Houston to restore the home of a local disabled senior known as Ms. Angela and provide athletes the opportunity to volunteer for a service project on April 19. Together they will band together to complete the exterior work on Ms. Angela’s home. In addition, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute $100,000 in charitable giveback to nonprofit initiatives and groups in the greater Harris County and Montgomery County regions in conjunction with the 2017 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> North American Championship Texas triathlon taking place on Saturday, April 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thankful to partner with The IRONMAN Foundation again this year,” said Jim Soller, Rebuilding Together Houston Executive Director. “These amazing athletes have put a tremendous amount of time into training and traveling to the race.  We are humbled by their additional efforts to support the Houston community with our home repair project.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. This year’s grant funding brings the total giveback to more than $820,000 in the region since the first event in The Woodlands. In 2017, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.5 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to Rebuilding Together Houston, eight local non-profit organizations will receive Community Grant awards during IRONMAN Texas race week. They include Montgomery County Youth Services, Interfaith of the Woodlands, South County Football League, Education for Tomorrow Alliance, Boy Scouts of America Troop 491, Meals on Wheels Montgomery County, Montgomery County Amateur Radio Emergency Service and Let Them Drum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinciding with the service project and grant funding, The IRONMAN Foundation will assemble backpacks filled with healthy snacks, a personal note from an IRONMAN athlete, and tools to inspire local students to eat well, exercise, and live a healthy lifestyle, giving athletes and their supporters the opportunity to connect to local youth and sending them the message that “We’ve got your back.” The backpacks will be presented to Montgomery County Youth Services, a 2017 Community Grant recipient that serves at-risk youth by providing crisis counseling, shelter programs and prevention services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a privilege to support so many incredible local community organizations,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact here in Texas. It will be a highlight to meet Ms. Angela at the service project, introduce her to our IRONMAN athletes and TriClubs and welcome her home.”&nbsp;</p>

<strong>IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside | Post-Race Recap</strong>
</h2>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation launched our first charitable givebacks and multiple initiatives for the 2017 season at IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside, which took place on Sunday, April 1. Over $33,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups will be awarded in the greater Oceanside, California community. “We are honored to support so many outstanding local community organizations,” said Sarah Hartmann, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. “Together we are creating a lasting and tangible impact in Oceanside. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 47 community groups in the region.” Over 300 Community Fund athletes raced at IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside in support of IRONMAN Foundation programs, and their incredible generosity will help fund vital programs and fulfill our mission to create positive tangible impact in IRONMAN race communities. There were lots of high fives as the athletes entered the water on a very brisk race morning, and huge smiles when they crossed the finish line near Oceanside Pier. It was a perfect day to race!</p>

<strong>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">IMF VOLUNTEER APPRECIATION PROGRAM LAUNCH</span>
<br>
</strong>The new IRONMAN Foundation Volunteer Appreciation Program was launched at Oceanside to acknowledge volunteers for their contributions over race weekend. As they checked in, athletes received red IRONMAN Foundation wristbands with the instructions to give them to their favorite volunteers to “thank them for their service through sport and commitment to community.” It takes thousands of volunteers to bring IRONMAN athletes across the finish line every year. The red wristband is now our ‘Symbol of Service,’ providing athletes with the opportunity to show appreciation to a volunteer that helps them reach their IRONMAN goal. The Volunteer Group with the most wristbands at the end of race weekend received special acknowledgement from the IRONMAN Foundation. José Angel has been a Marine for 12 years, has made four deployments to Japan and Iraq and is stationed at Camp Pendleton. On Saturday at IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside, he volunteered on the run course at the big uphill on Oceanside Pier, urging athletes to dig deep and keep going. José received a total of 74 Volunteer Appreciation Wristbands from our IRONMAN athletes. In his words, “the experience was unforgettable. I’ll never forget it.”</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">TRICLUBS IN SERVICE PROGRAM LAUNCH</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Two IRONMAN TriClubs received a Bronze Medal of Service for their support and participation in the service project, Oceanside Multisport Group (OMG) and Salt Lake Tri Club. OMG received Top TriClub honors for raising the most support. More than 45 athletes volunteered, including the TriClub members, six-time IRONMAN World Champion Dave Scott and Lionel Sanders, winner of Saturday’s 2017 IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside and the “world’s fastest IRONMAN.”</p>

<strong>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">THE IMF 2017 JUNIOR SEAU FOUNDATION ADAPTIVE YOUTH SURF CLINIC, PRESENTED BY CAF</span>
</strong>
<br>
On Sunday, April 2, an adaptive surf clinic for youth as part of the Junior Seau Foundation Adaptive Youth Surf Program presented by Challenged Athletes Foundation, was held on the beach next to Oceanside Pier. This was the first of eight service projects the IRONMAN Foundation is scheduled to lead for 2017. The clinic hosted twenty kids with physical challenges who spent the morning learning to paddle and surf with the assistance of volunteers including professional triathletes, coaches and IRONMAN TriClub athletes from The IRONMAN Foundation’s new “TriClubs in Service” initiative.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17545263_1423576517705654_6706333845328631613_o-1024x683.jpg">The surf clinic was a morning full of inspiration, smiles and “stoke.” Our volunteers spent the morning in the water as “catchers” for the CAF athletes. Words cannot describe the experience of helping the young and courageous athletes, like 12 year old Adrian, who lost his leg when a drunk driver hit him with his car, stand up on his board and ride the waves. Athletes, their families and volunteers had lunch together and the CAF athletes were presented with race medals from IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside and custom trophies from Ashworth Awards. For all of us, it was a day we’ll never forget.</p>

<strong>WOW</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>What a week! IRONMAN Arizona is over, and just like that, the 2016 IRONMAN race season comes to a close. As the last, but certainly not least, race of the year, IRONMAN Arizona stayed busy with the 350 IRONMAN Foundation Athletes racing! We could not have asked for a better race day- with overcast skies all day, and low (but not too low) temperatures. PR’s were happening left &amp; right. With $53,000 being given back to the IRONMAN Arizona race community, IRONMAN Foundation athletes were able to make their race journey have an impact long beyond race day. TEAM IMF athletes at IRONMAN Arizona totaled more than 50 strong, and raised over $240,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/community-fund/">Community Fund</a>. <em>Yup, you read that right- $242,000</em>!!!!</p>
<p>Do you want to help make our impact even stronger? Check out TEAM IMF <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/">HERE</a>, and find out how you can be a catalyst for change in 2017.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>IRONMAN Florida never fails to be an amazing experience for triathletes. With the beautiful Panama City Beach at your fingertips (literally, on race day), you can’t help but feel excited to race 140.6 miles in such a great town. Even more exciting was the fact that The IRONMAN Foundation had 16 athletes racing IRONMAN Florida. Not only did they race, though, they fundraised a cause that makes an impact beyond race day. With over $63,000 raised from these incredible athletes, organizations within IRONMAN race communities will receive grant funding to help run programs that make our world a better place. From the local Panama City Beach Police Department, to Girls Inc., to Panama City Beach Parks and Recreation, the impact of TEAM IMF athletes is felt far and wide.</p>
<p>In addition to these 16 TEAM IMF athletes, The IRONMAN Foundation had 220 (WOAH!) Foundation athletes that supported our mission through a donation made during their IMFL entry purchase. Because of them, over $88,000 was given back through grant funding to the local Panama City Beach Community. We can’t thank all of our Foundation Athletes enough for their incredible support and hard work.

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute over $88,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Panama City Beach, FL region in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Florida triathlon taking place on Saturday, November 5, 2016.  The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $605,000 in the region. In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $5,000 community grant to Girls Inc. of Bay County to purchase age-appropriate fitness equipment to improve their Mind+Body and Sporting Chance programs for girls ages six to eighteen, which will help positively impact on the health and wellbeing of their girls, assisting with the development of necessary habits for being healthy adults.</p>
<p>“Girls Inc. of Bay County is very grateful for the support of the IRONMAN Foundation for our Healthy Living programs.  Only 18% of high school girls report engaging in the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity daily” said Niki Kelly, Executive Director of Girls Inc. of Bay County. “With the funds from the IRONMAN Foundation we will be able to purchase a variety of age-appropriate fitness equipment for our Mind + Body program to help our girls develop healthy active living habits. At Girls Inc. our mission is to inspire all girls to be Strong, Smart, and Bold so that they can grow up to be Healthy, Educated, and Independent.”</p>
<p>Another featured grant recipient, the Panama City Beach Parks &amp; Recreation Department, will receive a $5,000 grant to place handicap-accessible beach mats at the Russell-Fields City Pier, which will allow those who are wheelchair-bound or have difficulty walking to be able to successfully access their beautiful beach.  “The PCB Parks &amp; Recreation Department strives to provide recreational opportunities for all,” said Melissa, Deese, Facilities &amp; Special Events Coordinator of the Panama City Beach Parks &amp; Recreation Department.  “We are grateful for the IRONMAN Foundation’s donation for the funds to purchase additional beach access mats that will allow additional access for those in wheelchairs or who have trouble walking in sand.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Panama City Beach community with these community grant awards.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s grant recipients at the Athlete Welcome Banquet at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, 2016 at the Boardwalk Beach Resort.</p>

<strong>
<em>
<u>Volunteerism Grants<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide over $35,000 in volunteer grant donations for the IRONMAN Florida triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve others within the Panama City Beach region year-after-year,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 48 community groups in the region.<br>

<strong>
<em>
<u>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will award three grants to purchase life-saving equipment totaling over $43,000 to local first-responder agencies, including Panama City Beach Fire Rescue, Panama City Beach Police Department, and Panama City Police Department. <strong>

</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Panama City Beach Fire Rescue will receive a grant valued at $7,406 to purchase ballistic vests to protect first responders as they retrieve injured civilians and/or law enforcement during incidents where weapons are involved.  ”These vests will provide our first response medical staff with needed protection in several environments that plague our society today, such as active shooter events, incidents of domestic violence, and any other type of incidents where we are called upon to assist Law Enforcement that may involve weapons,” said Panama City Beach Fire Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Larry Couch.  “Many incident casualties can be reduced by immediate medical treatments and with this ballistic protection, our medical staff can center ‘clear’ areas or ‘warm zones’ to collect and move victims to collection areas for treatment and/or transport.”</p>
<p>The Panama City Beach Police Department will receive a $17,303 grant to purchase two ATV’s to better respond and assist the public in areas that otherwise are inaccessible to police vehicles.  “Much of our City is beach sand and undeveloped land, which makes it difficult to properly patrol and/or respond in regular patrol vehicles,” said Panama City Beach Police Lieutenant Danny McDonald. “We have several old ATVs that are in need of replacement and this grant will enable us to better serve the community.”</p>
<p>The Panama City Police Department will additionally receive a $18,854 grant to purchase collapsible pop-up LED traffic cones to provide for safer roadways, and a vehicular radio repeater that will allow for clear and reliable communication in the event of a natural disaster or act of terrorism.</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>IRONMAN Foundation Athletes<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>TEAM IMF is The IRONMAN Foundation’s fundraising triathlon team. Team members have the opportunity to race in the IRONMAN event of their choice when they commit to raise $3,500 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Twenty-four athletes participating in this program through the 2016 IRONMAN Florida triathlon have raised over $58,000, while collectively all of The Foundation’s TEAM IMF athletes have raised over $575,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund in 2016.</p>
<p>Over two hundred athletes also registered via an IMF Community Fund entry, where a portion of their registration was a tax-deductible donation back to IMF.  Through their entries, over $114,000 was raised for IMF’s Community Fund to go back to deserving organizations within IRONMAN race communities.<br>

</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. The Children’s Tumor Foundation is the Official Charity Partner of the 2016 IRONMAN Florida triathlon. With almost 125 athletes racing at IRONMAN Florida, the Children’s Tumor Foundation NF Endurance team is committed to raising fundraising dollars and awareness to fund research in order to find a cure for NF (neurofibromatosis). “Our athletes are helping us to further our mission to end NF,” said Angela Earle, Manager for the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Just five years ago, there were only a handful of clinical trials for NF. Today, the Children’s Tumor Foundation has funded over 100. Our athletes are a part of the reason why we have been able to fund so much research.  Since partnering with IRONMAN, our athletes have collectively raised over $1.7 million dollars.  Because of these athletes we are able to give hope to those living with NF.”</p>
<p>Partnering with an IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> or IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup> event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission. Through these partnerships, $6,397,900 was raised to support their respective missions in 2015 alone, and $18.6 million since the beginning of The IRONMAN Foundation’s charity partnership program.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Despite the challenges presented to IRONMAN Maryland athletes this year, they “weathered the storm” and displayed true IRONMAN grit, even in the midst of a tough day. With a cancelled swim, TEAM IMF Athletes rolled out onto the bike course as the first athletes in line. Throughout the rest of race day, TEAM IMF athletes had smiles on their faces, for even though the day may not have gone as planned, their positive impact on the IRONMAN Maryland Community would last far beyond race day.</p>
<p>With 12 Athletes raising almost $40,000, these guys have truly become role models for triathletes around the globe. Dedicating their races to giving back to IRONMAN Communities, and racing for a cause greater than themselves, has made their race day about so much more than crossing that finish line! To read more on how the IRONMAN Maryland Community was changed by these incredible athletes, take a look at the IRONMAN Maryland Giveback Article <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/immd16/">HERE</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What a beautiful day to become an IRONMAN!</p>
<p>In Louisville, KY., we were greeted with perfect race day weather, southern hospitality, and an amazing group of IRONMAN Foundation Athletes that made it their top priority to <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/">Race For More</a> this year at IRONMAN Louisville. With a race week Luncheon to kick-off the week full of fun events, TEAM IMF athletes were able to sit down with one another, and hear some amazing stories of courage, perserverance, and how they made a difference this year through their fundraising.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, these guys raised over $35,000 for our IRONMAN Race Communities. THAT. IS. AWESOME. To find out more about the IRONMAN Louisville Giveback, check out our 2016 IRONMAN Louisville Giveback story <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/imlou16/">HERE</a>.</p>

<strong>IRONMAN Chattanooga | Heat &amp; Hills</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>With record heat in the high 90’s all week, athletes knew that the hilly course was not going to be the only challenge on race day! But, our incredible IRONMAN Foundation Athletes perservered, and knew that their race meant more than crossing the finish line; it meant they were helping to provide over $70,000 to the IRONMAN Chattanooga race community. 145 <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/foundation-slots/">Community Fund Athletes</a>, and 12 <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/">TEAM IMF Athletes</a>, made a difference this year in Chattanooga by providing grants to Downside Up, and Friends of The Outdoor Chattanooga.

</p>
<p>Racing her 3rd full IRONMAN event later this month at IRONMAN Chattanooga, Erica has her eyes set on an even loftier goal- The 2017 IRONMAN World Championships. How’s she going to get there? By being a catalyst for change, and raising over $25,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation. While $25,000 may seem like a big number; impossible even, to some; it doesn’t scare Erica in the slightest bit. In fact, she’s almost there already, with over $22,000 raised so far! Through her IRONMAN Chattanooga journey, she’s going to be changing many more lives than just her own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>What is your ‘IRONMAN resume’? (How many races you have under your belt, etc)</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have competed in 2 full IRONMAN events (both at IRONMAN Florida) and 4 IRONMAN 70.3 events (3x at IRONMAN 70.3 Florida, 1x at IRONMAN 70.3 Miami).  After IRONMAN Chattanooga in September I plan on racing IRONMAN 70.3 Miami again in October, and the Miami Man (Olympic distance) in November. Over the past approximate 13 years of racing I have participated in all kinds of races (running, triathlons, and century rides) and have successfully completed probably over 75 total races.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Why did you decide to Race For More this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to Race for More this year with The IRONMAN Foundation as a way to give back to local organizations.  I like the fact that 100% of donations go to local organizations.  It seems like many organizations you donate to, the donations go to administration salaries etc.  I like the fact that all the money will go to organizations in need.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far?</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My most successful method of fundraising has been sending out bright and glittery cards to family, friends, and fellow colleagues explaining what The IRONMAN Foundation is and why it is important to donate to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Any words of wisdom for first-time IRONMAN Athletes?</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Breath, smile, and enjoy every minute, even when it starts to hurt and you have been out on the course for hours.  Also, be sure to thank a volunteer-without them there would be no race!  When you finish the sense of pride you and your family and friends will have for you will be amazing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>What is a fun/unexpected fact about yourself?</em>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t really have anything fun and unexpected about myself. I completed the IRONMAN University Certified Coach course last year.  I have always participated in sports in some way throughout my life.  I think that someday I would like to train and compete in an ultrathon.  I think that this would be a great challenge and another amazing goal to reach.</p>

</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute over $88,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Madison, Wisconsin region in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Wisconsin triathlon taking place on Sunday, September 11, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $967,000 in the region since the first event in Madison in 2003. During 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will provide a $35,000 Community Grant to the Madison Area Sports Commission (MASC) to support their youth grant initiative, which provides support to organizations that serve adolescents under the age of seventeen throughout Dane County.  “Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation.  “We are thrilled to support the Madison community with this community grant award.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation/MASC partnership will be recognized at the Athlete Welcome Banquet at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, September 9, 2016 at the Monona Terrace Exhibition Hall.</p>
<p>

<em>
<u>Volunteerism Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide over $35,000 in volunteer grant donations for the IRONMAN Wisconsin triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve others within the Madison region year-after-year,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 43 community groups in the region.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will provide a grant of $7,483 to the City of Madison Police Departm<br>
ent K9 Unit to provide protective equipment for the K9 Unit’s first bomb dog<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Firehouse-Subs-Foundation-Logo-150x150.jpg">, which will include an explosive storage magazine, bit suit, and four training collars.</p>
<p>“Having a K-9 Unit in Madison has proven invaluable in advancing the public safety needs of our community,” said City of Madison Police Department Chief Michael Koval.  “Our well-trained dogs and handlers have supplemented our Patrol Officers in tracking fugitives, evidence recovery, drug detection, cleared dangerous places and spaces, located missing and/or endangered persons, bomb detection, and serve as premier ambassadors of the department at various community gatherings and engagement opportunities.  Most people do not realize our team is funded almost entirely by a not-for-profit.  In these challenging financial times, we are truly grateful to the Firehouse Sub Public Safety Foundation and IRONMAN Foundation for the generous grant they awarded our K-9 unit. This grant has helped provide the team with much-needed equipment necessary to do the job and to grow our team’s capacity in serving an ever-expanding metropolitan area.”</p>
<p>An additional $15,510 grant will be awarded to the City of Madison Fire Department to purchase a Hurst E-Hydraulic “Jaws of Life” extrication tool that will help save victims in life-and-death situations.</p>
<p>“We as a department truly appreciate the generosity and opportunity the IRONMAN Foundation and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation has given the department to provide ‘state of the art’ extrication equipment,” said City of Madison Fire Department Chief Steven Davis.  “The Madison Fire Department responds to thousands of motor vehicle accidents annually.  This donation allows the fire department to provide improved response when dealing with motor vehicle accidents.  The IRONMAN Foundation and Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation are strong partners in the commitment to better serve the citizens and visitors to the City of Madison.”</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation will recognize both departments at the start of the 2:00 p.m. Athlete Briefing on Thursday, September 8, 2016 at the Monona Terrace ballroom.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute $60,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Coeur d’Alene region in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Coeur d’Alene triathlon taking place on Sunday, August 21, 2016.  With this most recent donation from The IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $80,000 has been given back to the Coeur d’Alene community this year.  The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $715,000 in the region. In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will distribute $25,000 in grants to deserving organizations making a positive impact within Kootenai County.  One featured grant recipient, the Coeur d’Alene Parks &amp; Recreation Department, will receive a $10,000 grant to provide low-cost programs with available scholarships for all those who wish to participate in their recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>“We as a community are happy to have this partnership with IRONMAN and believe that Coeur d’Alene is the perfect venue for both the 70.3 and the full IRONMAN,” said Bill Greenwood, Coeur d’Alene Parks &amp; Recreation Director.  “Our ongoing relationship over the years with the IRONMAN Foundation has allowed us to provide recreational scholarships to the youth of the area an opportunity that otherwise may have been missed for these children to participate in our activities and for those who could become the next great athlete to be discovered.”</p>
<p>Another featured grant recipient, the Salvation Army Ray &amp; Joan Kroc Corps Community Center, will be receiving a $10,000 grant to support their third-grade learn-to-swim program, which teaches children critical water safety skills and swim basics.  This will be the eighth year the IRONMAN Foundation has supported this important initiative.  To date, 5,767 children from 16 North Idaho Schools have participated in the program.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/3rd-grade-swim-4.jpg">
</p>
<p>“Our goal is to save lives,” said Salvation Army Kroc Center Development Coordinator, Cynthia Rozyla, “The third-grade swim is making that possible and the IRONMAN Foundation has been the key to that success.”</p>
<p>A third featured recipient, North Idaho College, will receive a $5,000 grant to provide students from Kootenai County with scholarship support.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the North Idaho College community, we thank you for your generous contribution to support student scholarships at North Idaho College.  Every dollar you have donated will provide scholarship support for students in their pursuit of an education and a brighter future,” said North Idaho College Foundation Executive Director Rayelle Anderson. “We thank the IRONMAN Foundaton for partnering with us to help change lives one student at a time.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are pleased to be able to support the Coeur d’Alene region with these community grants.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s community grant recipients at the athlete welcome ceremony taking place at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, August 19, 2016 at Bandshell City Park.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Even the mental endurance race of law school won’t stop Miriam Swedlow from achieving her dream of racing her first IRONMAN! As a self-proclaimed “DIY Athlete”, Miriam focuses making the sport inviting for all who dare to dream (herself included), rather than having the latest and greatest aero gear. By supporting The IRONMAN Foundation through her race this year, Miriam has given new meaning to her IRONMAN Journey, and knows that no accomplishment is achieved in isolation- she’s so thankful for the Coeur d’Alene race community that will be supporting her through her race day!</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>What is your ‘IRONMAN resume’? </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Coeur D’Alene will be my first full distance IRONMAN! I have completed the Lake Stevens Half IRONMAN three times and have finished many Olympic and sprint distance races over the past eight years. I had hoped to complete a full distance IRONMAN the year that I turned forty, but this goal shifted when I began the intellectual endurance race of law school at the University of Washington. As I entered the final stretch of law school my mind turned again to the IRONMAN and my personal goal to complete a full distance race. I began training the first week of March, graduated in June, took the bar exam on July 26 and 27, and hope to finally cross the finish line in Coeur D’Alene in a few weeks.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Why did you decide to #RaceForMore this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I decided to fund raise for the IRONMAN Foundation because I know that no accomplishment is achieved in isolation. It is only with the support of community that we are able to rise and become our better selves. I decided to go to law school in order to have a greater impact as an advocate in healthcare (I am a RN and working in a hospital for over 12 years). But for the past three years my focus has been sharpened on trying to balance school and my family. As I moved closer to graduation I wanted desperately to give back. I love that the IRONMAN Foundation is not limited to one cause, but instead provides funding and support to a vast array of organizations and groups. Fundraising for IMF has made my preparation for race day more meaningful and I look forward to crossing off each mile with the knowledge that I am not alone, but have the support and encouragement of each person that donated to my campaign.  Although the physical effort is mine alone, when I (hopefully) cross the finish line, the victory will belong to all of us together.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>The greatest success I have had is simply taking the time to ask. Although posting to Facebook and other social media spaces brought in some support, the vast amount of donations that I received was from me writing people and asking for their help. Sometimes more than once. It is hard to ask people for money, but this is such a great cause I never felt bad reaching out. The worst thing that can happen is they say “no.” But I was blown away by the support and from people’s willingness to ask others on my behalf. It has been humbling and rewarding.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Any words of wisdom for first-time IRONMAN Athletes?</em>
<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I am what I like to call a “DIY athlete.” I do not have fancy or high-tech gear (my bike is close to ten years old and I bought it used!). I do not belong to a training group or have a personal trainer. But I have not let that stop me. Instead, I created a training plan from books that I researched from the library. I ask questions and learn from fellow triathletes. I remind myself that I am not there to compete with anyone but my own mind that challenges me with self-doubt and insecurities. While I certainly am victim to “gear envy” from time to time, I love my bike and am able to use it not only for triathlons but for other cycling events. When you come to events it can be pretty intimidating—everyone looks so professional and strong. But I am here to remind you that triathlons are for everyone, not just professionals and weekend warriors. The hardest part is simply showing up and taking those first steps.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>What is a fun/unexpected fact about yourself?</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I met my husband when I was 17 and living on a school bus following the Grateful Dead. Together we have five amazing children. Our oldest is 23 and he is engaged to a wonderful woman from Spokane, WA who grew up volunteering for IRONMAN Coeur D’Alene. Our 20 year old daughter and 18 year old son have both moved to Israel, become dual citizens and are serving in the Israel Defense Forces. This means that we only have two kids at home, two boys ages 15 and 10. It truly has been a wild adventure and I am looking forward to the new challenges ahead.<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Miriam-Swedlow_2.jpg">

<![CDATA[<p>As a veteran IRONMAN and endurance athlete with more than his fair share of races under his belt, Zvi Donat has made it his mission to give back in everything that he does. Racing this weekend at IRONMAN Boulder is going to be an incredible experience for him, made even more so by the fact that Zvi is helping to improve the lives of others in the IRONMAN Boulder race community. By raising over $3,700 for IRONMAN race communities through his TEAM IMF Fundraising, Zvi is going to be providing vital grants to local nonprofits within the Boulder community; many of which would not receive funding otherwise.</p>
<p>

<em>IRONMAN Resume </em>
</strong> </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<br>
</span>
</p>
<p>Over 25 endurance events completed, and still going!</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Why did you decide to #RaceForMore this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I have dedicated most of my races to charity, including Children with Cancer, and Schneider Hospital. When I saw the opportunity to race for IRONMAN Foundation, I was so excited to be able to help those in need, when oftentimes this is a very selfish sport.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I have a very large network of supporters, friends, and relatives that follow me on my adventures. My family uses this network for every race and I have opened a web page that promotes the races I take part in, so in my view a personal Internet site and social media is the best way to bring your ideas to the public.</p>

</p>
<p>My words of wisdom to a first timer: Set your mind on a goal, don’t let the surrounding influences get in your way, keep the plan going and most importantly: less is more!</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Fun Facts?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I take on tremendous challenges such as Ultraman Florida and IRONMAN events. I race around the world. I am an IRONMAN certified coach but at the same time I am the king of T1 and T2… I love to take my time in transition, which makes my coach laugh at me nonstop, he says “it looks as if you blow dry your hair in there.”</p>

</p>
<p>Before race day heated up, we had the opportunity to greet some of our athletes at Expo with a small token of our appreciation- a towel for transition! Each Foundation Athlete made a tax-deductible donation to our Community Fund as part of their IRONMAN Lake Placid registration entry. With the amazing help of these athletes, $60,000 in grants were given to deserving non-profit organization in the greater Adirondack region.  Also at Expo, non-perishable food items were collected to benefit the Lake Placid Ecumenical Food Pantry at St. Agnes Church.</p>

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute $50,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Boulder region in conjunction with the 2016 Blueprint for Athletes IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Boulder triathlon taking place on Sunday, August 7, 2016.  With this most recent donation from the IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $70,000 has been given back to the Boulder community this year.  The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $470,000 in the region. In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will distribute a $10,000 Community Grant to Paradox Sports, to support adaptive outdoor adventure programs in Boulder.     This contribution from the IRONMAN foundation allows Paradox Sports to organize, coordinate and facilitate adaptive rock and mountain climbing experiences for adults, youth and military veterans with physical disabilities.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Paradox-Sports_2.jpg">
</p>
<p>“The grant has been an absolute game-changer for our organization. In addition to exploring America’s most iconic National Parks and summiting world-class peaks all over the United States, we now have the funding we need to make our backyard in beautiful Boulder more accessible for people with disabilities,” said Executive Director of Paradox Sports, Mike Neustedter. “Our community has been requesting more local services for years and we are now able to lead local participants up Boulder’s famous Flatirons and host rock climbing programs in both Boulder and Eldorado Canyon thanks to the support of the IRONMAN Foundation.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that the IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are pleased to be able to support the Boulder region with this community grant to Paradox Sports.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s community grant recipients at the athlete welcome ceremony taking place at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, August 5, 2016 at the Pearl Street Mall on the Boulder County Courthouse Lawn.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Volunteerism Grants<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide $40,000 in volunteer grant donations for the Blueprint for Athletes IRONMAN Boulder triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve others within the beautiful Boulder community,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 40 community groups in the region.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IRONMAN-Boulder-Volunteers.jpg">
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Team IMF<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>TEAM IMF is The IRONMAN Foundation’s fundraising triathlon team. Team members have the opportunity to race in the IRONMAN event of their choice when they commit to raise $3,500 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Two athletes participating in this program through the 2016 Blueprint for Athletes IRONMAN Boulder triathlon have raised over $7,000, while collectively all of The Foundation’s TEAM IMF athletes have raised over $380,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund in 2016.</p>

<em>Representatives from all three organizations will work to rebuild a Community Center in<br>Manta, Ecuador as part of All You Need is Ecuador IRONMAN 70.3 Ecuador race week</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla. </strong>(July 14, 2016) –The IRONMAN Foundation® and Race2Rebuild, the nonprofit endurance<br>sports program supporting disaster recovery, are heading to Ecuador to support continued earthquake<br>recovery during race week as part of All You Need is Ecuador IRONMAN® 70.3® Ecuador. Manta, Ecuador, the site of IRONMAN 70.3 Ecuador, is one of the most critical communities in need of help following massive earthquakes in April 2016 that decimated the area and claimed more than 600 lives.</p>



<p>
<br>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes, we hope to be able to make a difference in a community that has opened its arms to support us,” said David Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation.</p>



<p>
<br>The IRONMAN Foundation and Race2Rebuild have partnered with All Hands Volunteers to build a SER<br>Community Center in a new housing development, Ceibo Renacer, located in the outskirts of Manta. Ceibo Renacer currently has 55 houses, which is just the start of a much bigger settlement planned by the city. Approximately 575 families and approximately 2,300 people will benefit from this community center, and will improve the quality of health, education, and recreation for all residents.</p>



<p>
<br>“A community’s recovery process following a disaster is the ultimate endurance event,” said Race2Rebuild<br>President Sarah Hartmann. “We are truly grateful to The IRONMAN Foundation and our rebuilding partner. All Hands Volunteers for the opportunity to bring together athletes and volunteers and create tangible impact in Manta.” </p>



<p>“When disaster strikes, homes, schools and community centers are devastated,” said All Hands Volunteers Executive Director and CEO Erik Dyson. “But one of the greatest costs is the loss of hope that can occur in the sometimes overwhelming aftermath. As we come together to build this community center, we will give this area a place to gather, but more importantly, we will also show them by our actions that there is hope.” </p>



<p>To support this initiative, individuals can help The IRONMAN Foundation reach their $50,000 fundraising goal by donating online at www.crowdrise.com/ironman-for-relief, or by signing up to tour the project on<br>Saturday, July 30, and volunteer on Monday, August 1 online at www.race2rebuild.org/2016-events.<br>Volunteer Registration will be open until July 29.</p>



<p>
<br>To support the initiative, the IRONMAN Foundation will hold a drawing for one (1) entry to the 2017<br>IRONMAN® 70.3® World Championships in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Those who donate $50 or more<br>online or register to volunteer and participate in the August 1 service project in Manta will be automatically<br>entered in the contest.</p>

<em>Representatives from all three organizations will work to rebuild a Community Center in<br>Manta, Ecuador as part of All You Need is Ecuador IRONMAN 70.3 Ecuador race week</em>
</p>



<p>TAMPA, Fla. (July 14, 2016) –The IRONMAN Foundation® and Race2Rebuild, the nonprofit endurance<br>sports program supporting disaster recovery, are heading to Ecuador to support continued earthquake<br>recovery during race week as part of All You Need is Ecuador IRONMAN® 70.3® Ecuador. Manta, Ecuador, the site of IRONMAN 70.3 Ecuador, is one of the most critical communities in need of help following massive earthquakes in April 2016 that decimated the area and claimed more than 600 lives. </p>



<p>“IRONMAN is about creating a sense of community, and through the support and generosity of our athletes, we hope to be able to make a difference in a community that has opened its arms to support us,” said David Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. </p>



<p>The IRONMAN Foundation and Race2Rebuild have partnered with All Hands Volunteers to build a SER Community Center in a new housing development, Ceibo Renacer, located in the outskirts of Manta. Ceibo Renacer currently has 55 houses, which is just the start of a much bigger settlement planned by the city. Approximately 575 families and approximately 2,300 people will benefit from this community center, and will improve the quality of health, education, and recreation for all residents.</p>



<p>“A community’s recovery process following a disaster is the ultimate endurance event,” said Race2Rebuild<br>President Sarah Hartmann. “We are truly grateful to The IRONMAN Foundation and our rebuilding partner All Hands Volunteers for the opportunity to bring together athletes and volunteers and create tangible impact in Manta.”</p>



<p>“When disaster strikes, homes, schools and community centers are devastated,” said All Hands Volunteers<br>Executive Director and CEO Erik Dyson. “But one of the greatest costs is the loss of hope that can occur<br>in the sometimes overwhelming aftermath. As we come together to build this community center, we will<br>give this area a place to gather, but more importantly, we will also show them by our actions that there is<br>hope.”</p>



<p>To support this initiative, individuals can help The IRONMAN Foundation reach their $50,000 fundraising<br>goal by donating online at www.crowdrise.com/ironman-for-relief, or by signing up to tour the project on<br>Saturday, July 30, and volunteer on Monday, August 1 online at www.race2rebuild.org/2016-events.<br>Volunteer Registration will be open until July 29.</p>



<p>To support the initiative, the IRONMAN Foundation will hold a drawing for one (1) entry to the 2017<br>IRONMAN® 70.3® World Championships in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Those who donate $50 or more<br>online or register to volunteer and participate in the August 1 service project in Manta will be automatically entered in the contest.</p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Racing IRONMAN Vineman as a TEAM IMF athlete hits close to home for William Severi, <em>literally</em>. As a 30+ year local Santa Rosa resident, William is using his TEAM IMF journey to give back to the community that has supported him on race day, and beyond. Having been among the many athletes that travel through the IRONMAN Vineman course on training rides and runs, William will be making an impact right in his backyard this year. It is evident through his outstanding fundraising (currently at $7,440 raised) that this race is not just about crossing that finish line at the end of the month, it’s about making a difference in the lives of those who need it most.</span>

</em>
</strong> </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<br>
To date I have completed 10 half ironman races (70.3), 10 </span>olympic distance races, 1 full Ironman and, if all goes as planned, one more full Ironman at the end of July.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Why did you decide to #RaceForMore this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I love Santa Rosa and all of Sonoma County, it is my home, and I wanted to give back. I figured what better way to do so than by raising money through my race efforts and giving it back to this beautiful area.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>I do not often ask people for money but when I do, the people I am in relationship see the importance of my efforts and tend to want to invest in both me and foundation I support; it is a huge blessing to me.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Any words of Wisdom for first-time IRONMAN Athletes? </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>Remember to have a proper hydration and fuel plan for your race so you are able to finish strong. But most importantly do not forget to have fun because you are <strong>never</strong> going to make money doing this sport!</p>

<strong>Fun Facts? </strong>

</p>
<p>It gives me great joy when I go road biking with my son because it is one of the few areas of athleticism I can still beat him in!</p>

</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute $60,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Lake Placid, New York region in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Lake Placid triathlon taking place on Sunday, July 24, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $1,437,000 in the region since the first event in Lake Placid in 1999. During 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will distribute $20,000 in grants to deserving organizations making a positive impact in communities located in the Lake Placid region.  One featured grant recipient, The American Red Cross, will receive a $5,000 grant to assist with volunteer recruitment, disaster response training and reduce home fire deaths by providing free smoke alarms and conducing fire-safety plans with families.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“We are extremely grateful to the Ironman Foundation for their generous support and commitment to emergency preparedness in our community,” said Jane Gendron, executive director of the American Red Cross North Country Chapter. “This award enables the Red Cross to engage in critical local outreach activities to help people prevent and prepare for disasters like home fires. It also ensures that we can build and train a strong corps of local volunteers to provide disaster relief where it is needed most.”</p>
<p>Another featured grant recipient, the Lake Placid Outing Club, will be receiving a $5,000 grant to provide scholarships and subsidies to youth and families from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to enjoy wilderness trips that build a sense of self-esteem and satisfaction of achievement.</p>
<p>“The Lake Placid Outing Club is forever grateful to the IRONMAN Foundation for its continued and generous support of our scholarship fund for outdoor programming,” said Dave Balestrini, Board President of The Lake Placid Outing Club. “The support of the IRONMAN Foundation has allowed us to reach out to new families, increasing our participant and volunteer base by 10% in the 2016 spring season with the anticipation that this will continue to grow throughout the summer.  Through our scholarship program, area youth from all socio-economic backgrounds will be offered unrivaled, enriching outdoor activities from hiking to paddling, backpacking to mountain biking and much more.”</p>
<p>Volunteer first responder agencies within the region will also be awarded $10,000 in grant funding to help support their missions in providing much-needed resources, training, and equipment to volunteers that provide fire and EMS duties.</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that the IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are pleased to be able to support the greater Adirondack region and make a difference in the community that is so welcoming to IRONMAN and our athletes from all over the world.”</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Volunteerism Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide over $40,000 in volunteer grant donations for the IRONMAN Lake Placid triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve others within the Adirondack region year-after-year,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 31 community groups in the region.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5776-1024x768.jpg">
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Food Drive</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will be collecting canned goods to donate to the Lake Placid Ecumenical Food Pantry at St. Agnes Church.  Athletes are encouraged to bring at least one non-perishable item to the IRONMAN Foundation booth within the IRONMAN Village hours.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Featured Charity Partner</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is the Exclusive Charity Partner of the 2016 IRONMAN Lake Placid triathlon. Since 2014, over 100 athletes compete each year on the MMRF Team for Cures in Lake Placid and have raised upwards of $800,000 for life-extending cancer research. Nearly 90% of all funds raised by the MMRF and its Team for Cures athletes go directly to cancer research and related programming – helping to accelerate the development of next generation multiple myeloma treatments to prolong patients’ lives, and lead to a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MMRF.png">
<br>
Partnering with an IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> or IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup> event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission. Through these partnerships, $6,397,900 was raised to support their respective missions in 2015 alone, and $18.6 million since the beginning of The IRONMAN Foundation’s charity partnership program.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Longtime IRONMAN Foundation Athlete, Peter Anderson, was selected to be an IRONMAN Foundation TEAM IMF Ambassador for the 2016 season, where his passion and expertise are vital to showcasing what The IRONMAN Foundation is all about. He began his journey with The IRONMAN Foundation in 2009, when he raced his first IRONMAN as a Foundation Athlete, and has been an incredible ambassador for our programs ever since. Luck seemed to be on his side after all the good he has done for IRONMAN communities, as he secured his slot to the 2016 IRONMAN World Championships through the Legacy Program Drawing and he could not be more thrilled! With IRONMAN Vineman also on the schedule, Peter will be fundraising again this year as an IRONMAN Foundation TEAM IMF Ambassador, and continuing to help us make a difference our communities through fundraising and goodwill.</p>

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>My first IRONMAN was the 2009 IRONMAN Arizona, where I competed as a Foundation athlete.  In total, I have sixteen IRONMAN completions, three of them with Foundation entries.  I raced in Utah when the DNF rate was 29% (IRONMAN St. George- 2012), at 2015 IRONMAN Coeur d’Alene when the temperature was over 100 degrees, and at 2015 IRONMAN Arizona when it rained all day. Three times, when things didn’t go as planned, I finished in the last hour of the race, pushing those cutoffs.  Every single IRONMAN race was a remarkable experience and at least 80% fun.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Why did you decide to #RaceForMore this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I love it!  I started my IRONMAN experience as a Foundation athlete and I enjoy my IMF races the most.  I am never going to podium at an IRONMAN but I always feel like I win when I support the community through The IRONMAN Foundation.  It’s just a great feeling.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far? </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>After the first donations from friends and family, it gets tougher.  So to get people involved, I start asking for small donations, often just $10.  These add up.  And more importantly, these small donations are usually the first connection my donors have with The IRONMAN Foundation.  Those connections will last, helping to spread the word about the IMF, and leading to more donations in the future.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Any words of Wisdom for first-time IRONMAN Athletes? </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>There’s nothing like your first.  The day is so intense, however, that it can blur together in your memory.  During the race, from just before the start gun to after you cross the finish, take occasional mental snapshots to remember the moment.  Notice how things look, how you feel, what’s happening around you, and acknowledge what an amazing experience it is.  And put a donut in your Bike Special Needs bag.</em>
</p>

<em>My longtime girlfriend and I are getting married in September and the 2016 IRONMAN World Championship in Kona, Hawai’i will be our honeymoon.</em>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will facilitate and distribute over $27,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Muncie, Indiana community in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Muncie triathlon taking place on Saturday, July 9, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN events are held.  In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>

<u>Volunteerism Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
<br>
Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide $15,000 in volunteer grant donations for the IRONMAN 70.3 Muncie triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve the Muncie region,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 28 community groups in the region.</p>
<p>
<strong>

<u>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation</u>
</em>
</strong>
<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Firehouse-Subs-Foundation-Logo-150x150.jpg">The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will provide a grant of $14,475 to Delaware County EMS to purchase a LUCAS 2 CPR Chest Compression System that will help to improve outcomes of sudden cardiac arrest victims and improve operations for medical responders.<br>
“The willingness of the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and the IRONMAN Foundation to invest in our community is a true testament to their commitment to not only our first responders, but also the community as a whole,” said Executive Director of Emergency Management Jason Rodgers.  “With this grant we purchased a CPR device that has already been utilized multiple times and has made our paramedics more effective in prehospital care.”</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Get to know one of your TEAM IMF teammates, and top fundraisers, Todd Behringer. Todd will be racing with The IRONMAN World Championships this coming October in Kailua-Kona, Hawai’i. The Waco, Texas resident isn’t just racing to race though, he’s doing it to fuel life-changing grants within IRONMAN race communities and make a positive impact through his IRONMAN World Championship journey! You can also find him on the race course at IRONMAN Arizona later this year.</p>

<em>
<strong>Why did you decide to Race For More this year with The IRONMAN Foundation?</strong>
</em>
<br>
It started as a way for my son and myself to get involved in fundraising for his first full IRONMAN. He will turn 18 in October and IMAZ of course is in November.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What has been your most successful method of fundraising thus far?<br>
</strong>
</em>My most successful method of fundraising has been matching either $1 for $1 or $2 for $1 on a limited promotional basis to show my commitment in leading the charge.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Any “Words of Wisdom” for first-time IRONMAN Athletes?<br>
</strong>
</em>Train. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. Although you have 17 hours to finish, you don’t want to be out there that long.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>What is something unexpected about yourself that may surprise your teammates?<br>
</strong>
</em>I did not start running until 2009 at age 43. I did not start swimming until 2010 at age 44. I had my first child in 2012 at age 46. And now an entry into the IRONMAN World Championships in 2016 at age 50! #NeverTooLate</p>

<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IRONMAN-70.3-Syracuse-Finish-Line.png">The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will facilitate and distribute over $27,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Syracuse, New York community in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> 70.3<sup>®</sup> Syracuse triathlon taking place on Sunday, June 19, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN events are held.  In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Volunteerism Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide $20,000 in volunteer grant donations for the IRONMAN 70.3 Syracuse triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve the Syracuse region,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 22 community groups in the region.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Firehouse-Subs-Foundation-Logo-150x150.jpg">
</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will provide a grant of $7,300 to the Jamesville Fire District to purchase five Lifepak Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) that will be utilized in critical cardiac care situations.</p>
<p>“With the grant provided by the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation Team, the Jamesville Volunteer Fire Department will now be able to purchase five AED Lifepaks,” said Jamesville Fire District Chief William Johnson, “Three of these lifesaving pieces of equipment will be placed in each of our chief’s cars. With an average response time of 3-5 minutes for our chief cars, this equipment will be a huge difference maker in our chain of survival protocol. The two other AED Lifepaks will be placed on our engine and rescue- pumpers. We can’t thank the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation team or The IRONMAN Foundation enough for the grant and the support to the Jamesville Fire District.”</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s grant recipients at the Athlete Briefing taking place at 3:00 p.m. on Friday, June 17, 2016 at the IRONMAN Village at Jamesville Beach Park.</p>

<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1045_043616-1024x683.jpg">The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> will distribute $100,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Harris County and Montgomery County regions in conjunction with the 2016 Memorial Herman IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> North American Championship Texas triathlon taking place on Saturday, May 14, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteerism grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where IRONMAN events are held. The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to more than $720,000 in the region since the first event in The Woodlands. In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Community Grants</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will distribute $45,000 in grants to deserving organizations making a positive impact in communities located within Harris and Montgomery counties. One featured grant recipient, Race2Rebuild, will receive a $10,000 grant to support a disaster recovery project that will help rebuild two homes impacted by the recent flooding in the Houston area.</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with The IRONMAN Foundation for our Race2Rebuild Texas initiative in support of continued flood recovery in Houston,” said Sarah Hartmann, President of Race2Rebuild. “Together with our partners Rebuilding Together Houston and the Greater Houston Storm Recovery Network, and all our athletes and volunteers, we look forward to bringing home two of the many Houston families struggling to rebuild. To meet the families we support and help rebuild their homes is a truly inspiring moment and reinforces our commitment to every family affected by the continued flooding in Houston.”</p>
<p>For those that are interested in volunteering with Race2Rebuild during race week, visit: <a href="http://www.race2rebuild.org/2016-events/" target="_blank">http://www.race2rebuild.org/2016-events/</a> to sign up.</p>
<p>Another featured grant recipient, Interfaith of the Woodlands, will be receiving a $10,000 grant to provide housing to individuals and families that have been displaced due to recent flooding within Montgomery County.</p>
<p>“Interfaith of The Woodlands is so very grateful to receive Community Grant funding from The IRONMAN Foundation to assist with flood relief efforts that affected hundreds of our neighbors during the recent historic floods that hit our area. While homes and belongings were destroyed, the amazing spirit of our neighbors most impacted remains strong and resilient,” said Interfaith of the Woodlands President &amp; CEO Missy Herndon.  “We are so proud of the incredible outpouring of support from our wonderful community, congregations and corporations and now, The IRONMAN Foundation for supporting our neighbors as we get them back into permanent housing.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that the IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are pleased to be able to support the Harris and Montgomery counties with these community grants to help with their recovery efforts after the recent severe storms and flooding.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s community grant recipients at the athlete welcome banquet taking place at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 12, 2016 at the Waterway Marriot.</p>

<u>Volunteerism Grants</u>

<strong>
<em>
<u>Team IMF</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>TEAM IMF is The IRONMAN Foundation’s fundraising triathlon team. Team members have the opportunity to race in the IRONMAN event of their choice when they commit to raise $3,500 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Athletes participating in this program through the 2016 Memorial Herman IRONMAN North American Championship Texas triathlon have raised over $90,000, while collectively all of The Foundation’s TEAM IMF athletes have raised over $268,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund in 2016.</p>
<p>On Thursday of race week, TEAM IMF will also be conducting a volunteer service project with Montgomery County Youth Services at the BridgeWay Youth Shelter in Conroe, TX, speaking to children about the importance of sound nutrition, goal setting, and instilling the IRONMAN spirit that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE<sup>®</sup>.</p>

<u>Featured Charity Partner</u>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SAVE_THE_CHILDREN_LOGO_2.png">The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. Save the Children is the Premier Charity Partner of the 2016 Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Championship Texas triathlon. Their mission is to do whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to ensure children grow up healthy, educated and safe. Save the Children will race with a team of over 20 athletes and are on track to raise more than $100,000 for children’s relief work</p>
<p>Partnering with an IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> or IRONMAN 70.3<sup>®</sup> event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission. Through these partnerships, $6,397,900 was raised to support their respective missions in 2015 alone, and $18.6 million since the beginning of The IRONMAN Foundation’s charity partnership program.</p>

<strong>SUPER SEAL TRIATHLON VOLUNTEER GRANT | BOYS &amp; GIRLS CLUB OF VISTA, CALIFORNIA</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Vista, which is located in northern San Diego County, meets the needs of 2087 kids a year, many from families that are of lower/moderate income households that rely exclusively on the broad range of services the Club provides. Since 1963, their mission has been to inspire and enable all kids, ages 6-18, especially those whose situations require the most support, to reach their full potential as responsible and productive citizens.  The kids that attend the Club have a chance to break this cycle of poverty and can become a new empowered generation of successful and productive adults.</p>
<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Vista will be using their 2016 volunteerism grant from the IRONMAN Foundation to make their baseball field ready to go for children ages 6-18! For more information about the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Vista, visit: <a href="http://www.bgcvista.org/">http://www.bgcvista.org/</a>.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission.

<p>Another featured recipient, Habitat for Humanity of Southwest Utah, will receive a $3,500 grant to revitalize their website. “We are so appreciative of this support from The IRONMAN Foundation,” said Linda Baker, Executive Director of Habitat for Humanity Southwest Utah. “Because of this funding, our new website will provide us with improved connections to our community, our donors, and volunteers regarding events and home builds.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that the IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of the IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the greater St. George community with these community grant awards.”</p>

This story begins long before the start gun goes off, and ends long after crossing the finish line. These selfless athletes support the IRONMAN Foundation through fundraising, donations, and service projects. Thousands of charitable organizations will be able to continue the programs that help those who are often overlooked because of the contributions made by IRONMAN Foundation athletes.</h4>

<p>Proudly displaying the words “The IRONMAN Foundation” on their IRONMAN race day gear, these athletes can be found racing across the nation this season. From IRONMAN Texas, IRONMAN 70.3 Vineman, and IRONMAN Wisconsin, to IRONMAN Maryland &amp; IRONMAN Arizona, the TEAM IMF Ambassadors will go into our race communities to be the change. Through The IRONMAN Foundation’s mission of “Service Through Sport, Commitment To Community”, TEAM IMF ambassadors will not only fundraise to fuel life-changing grants; they will also step foot into the organizations that need help the most, and lend a helping hand to change the lives of those who are often overlooked.</p>
<p>
<em>“Being a TEAM IMF ambassador for [The IRONMAN Foundation] has added a great new aspect to IRONMAN events I previously didn’t know was possible. Using my love for the triathlon to raise money and awareness for charities local to the races I participate in has made this journey so much more meaningful to me than I could have ever imagined.”</em>– TEAM IMF Ambassador, Robert Maar</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation® will facilitate and distribute over $35,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Oceanside, California community in conjunction with the 2016 IRONMAN® 70.3® California triathlon taking place on Saturday, April 2, 2016. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. In 2016, The IRONMAN Foundation will distribute more than $1.6 million in grant funding to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<em>
<strong>Volunteerism Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide $25,000 in volunteer grant donations this year for the IRONMAN 70.3 California triathlon. “We are thrilled to continue our support of so many tremendous organizations that selflessly serve the Oceanside community,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 46 community groups in the region.</p>

</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will provide a grant of $10,540 to the Oceanside Fire Department Lifeguard Division to purchase a 2015 Yamaha VX100 Deluxe Wave Runner that will be a critical tool for lifeguard operations, enabling rapid rescue and retrieval of victims during rescue operations.</p>
<p>“In 2015, Oceanside had over 5.3 million beach visitors and over 2 million people in water attendance. This resulted in 103,000 preventative actions, 78,000 enforcement actions, and 3,000 rescues.” said Administrative Fire Captain, David Parsons. “Personal watercraft are an essential and integral part of lifeguard resources.”</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s grant recipients at the Athlete Briefing taking place at 2:00 p.m. on Friday, April 1, 2016 at the Junior Seau Pier Amphitheater.</p>

</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. &nbsp;CAF’s Operation Rebound® program is the official charity of IRONMAN 70.3 California. Since 2008, over $1.2 million has been raised through IRONMAN 70.3 races across the country. CAF’s Operation Rebound® program is a sports and fitness program for American military personnel, veterans and first responders with permanent physical disabilities. It provides unparalleled opportunities to pursue active, athletic lifestyles by offering access to funding for equipment and training and competition expenses, Military Medical Center Physical Training and sports clinics.</p>
<p>Partnering with an IRONMAN® or IRONMAN 70.3® event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission. Through these partnerships, $6,397,900 was raised to support their respective missions in 2015 alone, and $18.6 million since the beginning of The IRONMAN Foundation’s charity partnership program.</p>

<strong>8 Life Lessons Learned At The IRONMAN Bonk</strong>
</span>
<br>
<em>The IRONMAN Foundation’s TEAM IMF Athletes reveal what inspires them to be IRONMAN tough.</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>Brett McMahon, IRONMAN Louisville Finisher</strong>
</span>
<br>
“[I realized that] I possess the ability to inspire people. That thought literally brings wonderment to me… because, I’m really just a normal guy. A normal guy that chose to accept a challenge and merely just swam, biked, and ran my proverbial @SS off for six months before “toeing the line”. I received so much joy by looking at the crowds on the side of the road. I could see it in people’s eyes… and I heard it in their words. Imagine the possibilities if we could all inspire only a few people throughout the duration of our lives.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>Chris Keating, IRONMAN Maryland Finisher</strong>
</span>
<br>
“I’ve learned that if you dream big and work hard for it, dreams will come true. There is nothing that you can dream that you will not be able to achieve by putting your whole heart, soul and mind into. IRONMAN is a physical feat that appears to some as impossible, but to those that do it, realize that it is a journey of not just a physical challenge but one that changes your lifestyle, mindset and character. It builds grit, determination, perseverance and makes you find your personal motivation, all of which carry over into your everyday life to help you achieve your once thought “impossible” dreams and turns them into reality.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>Thomas Walls, <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/imf-behind-the-scenes-imchoo/" target="_blank">IRONMAN Chattanooga</a> Finisher</strong>
</span>
<br>
“There are numerous tasks that we do on a day to day basis that easily allows us to take credit for actions that we have no control over. On race day, however, you and only you are responsible for the outcome. Either you did the training or you didn’t. You either give up or go for it, but at the end of the day when you cross the line it is you and you alone who is accountable.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>Stewart Harmann, <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/im-arizona-behind-the-scenes/" target="_blank">IRONMAN Arizona</a> Finisher</strong>
</span>
<br>
“When I got off the bike at 7 hours total, I was shivering uncontrollably and sat down in the change tent to change my shoes. I looked at the volunteer there to help me and said, “I don’t want to go back out in this – I can’t do it.” He looked at me and said very assertively, “It is not going to get any better sitting here.” So, out I went, back out into the rain and cold. Another sweet volunteer gave me some light wool running gloves as I left still shivering and sent me running. Within a mile I felt really good again and started to warm up. For the next 26.2 miles, I thought about what those two volunteers did for me and taught me – it will never get any better if I just sit in the tent waiting for the situation to improve. You have to get moving, you have to stay focused and as you do so, things start to fall into place. You feel better, your perspective changes and there is more joy and “sunlight”.”</li>

</span>
<br>
“Being overweight and an alcoholic, close to taking my own life, led me to IRONMAN to find an escape from the demons that drove me to self-destruction. It was my IRONMAN experience that taught me strength, dedication, endurance and perseverance. The IRONMAN experience can be selfish at times, because it takes away from other commitments in your life, or most of the training is done as an individual, however, an experience fundraising for The IRONMAN Foundation taught me so many valuable lessons.”<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Article.jpg">

<strong>
<u>Stephanie Felber, IRONMAN Texas Finisher</u>
</strong>
<br>
“When I had bump in the road with cancer, a lot of people said I needed to slow down anyway. I remember my treatments &amp; always telling the nurses, I wasn’t normal, I was an IRONMAN. Cancer may have given me a hurdle, but I could jump that hurdle and still live my life. Being an IRONMAN gave me the strength to overcome and endure what I had to go through. I have learned to accept setbacks, regroup and move forward sometimes in a different direction. I always had a positive outlook on life and IRONMAN tests that every time with conditions, issues and unforeseen circumstances.”</li>

</span>
<br>
“I have always fancied myself a competitive person.  Someone who will do whatever it takes to win.  What IRONMAN taught me was that there are much bigger and more important results than winning. Perhaps the biggest lesson about the definition of “winning” is being involved in TEAM IMF, a program that allows you to raise money <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/community-fund/">for your community and non-profits</a> as you train, sweat and bleed for the sport you love.  IRONMAN is a sport of individual determination. Those of the “turtle community” listen to our own thoughts for 17 hours, and spend many of those hours trying to convince ourselves why not to quit. Through TEAM IMF, that never enters your mind. You can’t quit. Your community needs you.”</li>

“Once you finish your first IRONMAN you are empowered.  You cannot dispute that.  Though my first IRONMAN finish was to prove to myself that anything is possible and that I could do it, after that, the motivation becomes something more.  Not just to finish, but to inspire, motivate, and encourage others.  <strong>
<em>Race for More</em>

</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> (IMF) and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF) have partnered to provide $125,000 in grant funding for first responder groups in six communities where IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> races take place. These grants, awarded for the purchase of critical, life-saving equipment, will be distributed at IRONMAN events taking place between April 2 and October 9, 2016. Now in their third year of partnership, FHSPSF and IMF have previously awarded $197,577 worth of equipment to 15 first-responder organizations in nine IRONMAN race communities.</h4>
<h4>“We’re so fortunate at IRONMAN to work with an elite group of first responders in each of our race communities, as they are instrumental in ensuring the health and safety of our athletes,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager of IMF. “This partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation allows us to give back to the brave men and women who put their lives on the line for us each day by giving them the tools that they need to save lives.”</h4>
<h4>One featured grant recipient from 2015 was the Madison Police Department, who received a grant worth $18,700 to purchase Air-Purifying respirators that would allow their officers to operate more effectively for longer periods of time in critical situations. “The Madison Police Department greatly appreciates the support received from the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and The IRONMAN Foundation,” said Police Captain Victor Wahl. “The safety equipment provided has protected officers responding into hazardous environments and has enabled us to better serve the public.”</h4>

<em>$125,000 in grant funds available within six IRONMAN race communities</em>
</p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE/TAMPA, Fla (Feb. 24, 2016) – The IRONMAN Foundation® (IMF) and the Firehouse<br>Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF) have partnered to provide $125,000 in grant funding for first<br>responder groups in six communities where IRONMAN® races take place. These grants, awarded for the<br>purchase of critical, life-saving equipment, will be distributed at IRONMAN events taking place between<br>April 2 and October 9, 2016. Now in their third year of partnership, FHSPSF and IMF have previously<br>awarded $197,577 worth of equipment to 15 first-responder organizations in nine IRONMAN race<br>communities.</p>



<p>
<br>“We’re so fortunate at IRONMAN to work with an elite group of first responders in each of our race<br>communities, as they are instrumental in ensuring the health and safety of our athletes,” said Christine<br>Perkins, Community Relations Manager of IMF. “This partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety<br>Foundation allows us to give back to the brave men and women who put their lives on the line for us each day by giving them the tools that they need to save lives.”</p>



<p>
<br>One featured grant recipient from 2015 was the Madison Police Department, who received a grant worth<br>$18,700 to purchase Air-Purifying respirators that would allow their officers to operate more effectively for longer periods of time in critical situations. “The Madison Police Department greatly appreciates the support received from the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and The IRONMAN Foundation,” said Police Captain Victor Wahl. “The safety equipment provided has protected officers responding into hazardous environments and has enabled us to better serve the public.”</p>



<p>
<br>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation along with The IRONMAN Foundation is grateful for the<br>opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “This is the third year of this partnership and we are especially excited to reach out to new race cities throughout the country where we can provide support to the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting ours, every day.”</p>



<p>
<br>Grant awards through the FHSPSF/IMF partnership will range in size from $10,000 to $20,000, with the<br>maximum award capped at $20,000 per organization. Funds will be awarded to eligible groups in<br>communities where the following IRONMAN events take place: IRONMAN® 70.3® California; IRONMAN® 70.3® Muncie; IRONMAN® 70.3® Syracuse; IRONMAN® Wisconsin; IRONMAN® Maryland, and IRONMAN® Louisville presented by Norton Sports Health. The deadline to apply is March 1 for IRONMAN® 70.3® California, and April 1 for all other communities.

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>By Whitney Tizzano, Manager of Fundraising Programs</em>
</p>
<p>Everyone’s IRONMAN journey is different. The motivation, preparation, and race day is unique for each athlete, spectator, and volunteer. This is my IRONMAN journey and what managing our first TEAM IMF team, spending 44 days on the road, traveling 15,000 miles, and sending 10,470 emails taught me about IRONMAN, life, and resiliency in 2015.</p>
<p>
<strong>10) CROSS TRAINING IS IMPORTANT</strong>
<br>
Yoga, weight-training, and stretching are hugely important for strengthening and preventing injury. Cross training is also useful when attempting everyday tasks like curling into the fetal position on a 6:00 AM plane ride or climbing metal bins to extract a box larger than oneself.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12096241_1010258245704152_6234918298317262567_n-e1450815945686.jpg">
<br>
<strong>9) ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HEAD ON A SWIVEL</strong>
<br>
A great picture of Chris from our IRONMAN Florida team is forever ruined by me in the background doing who-knows-what with my right arm. It’s easy to get caught up in what we’re doing and what our goals are but it’s also important to occasionally look up and see how we may be affecting others and their goals. <img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1022-1024x683.jpg">
<br>
<strong>8) BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF</strong>
<br>
As much as I’d like to be, I am not a good gator driver. I drive too slow (a man in a suit walking on the sidewalk passed me once), can’t park it, and let’s not even talk about backing up. Sometimes we may not be the best equipped for a certain task and that’s okay. A team excels when we take out ego and optimize everyone’s talents for the greater good.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_4531-1024x768.jpg">
<br>
<strong>7) STEP OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE</strong>
<br>
I thrive on order, excel spreadsheets, and to-do lists. I never jay-walk or enter through the exit doors of a supermarket. However, growth happens when we stretch ourselves out of our comfort zone and move past self-inflicted limitations. In the beginning of 2015, I told myself that this year was going to plop me into situations that I’ve never experienced before and that it would be tough. There were times when all I wanted to do was hide in a blanket burrito but I didn’t; the temporary pain of testing moments is no match for the feeling of accomplishment.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_5554-e1450817974809-1024x802.jpg">
<br>
<strong>6) THE SOLUTION IS OFTEN SIMPLE</strong>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation launched a grassroots “Pay It Forward” campaign which included doing small Random Acts of Kindness around town. We tried to be inconspicuous as we hid in the background watching other patrons continue to “pay it forward” down the line. Our cover of anonymity was blown when we were spotted because of our IRONMAN Foundation shirts. In our panic, we brainstormed wild ideas on how to correct this which included everything from buying new shirts to hiding behind the counter. The winning idea was simple: just turn the shirt around. Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest.<br>
<strong>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_5515-1024x768.jpg">
<br>
5) MY VISUALIZATION DOESN’T ALWAYS MATCH THE OUTCOME</strong>
<br>
This picture is what happens when I’m asked to show my “Game Face”. At the time, I thought I was delivering a powerful and menacing stare that would intimidate even my biggest hypothetical hockey adversary. Although my stare may lack in intimidation it reminds me that it’s okay to put it all on the line even when the results may not turn out exactly as imagined.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_5481-e1450818144806-1024x710.jpg">
<br>
<strong>4) TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE LITTLE THINGS</strong>
<br>
I’m notorious for staying hyper focused on a goal. It’s the equivalent of getting to the marathon of an IRONMAN and focusing so much on the finish line that you miss your spectator crew cheering your name at mile 10. This year I reminded myself that it’s okay to snap out of it, recharge, and indulge in that chocolate covered maple ice cream cone.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_5784-e1450818367554-1024x771.jpg">
<br>
<strong>3) SOMETIMES YOU NEED A FRESH PAIR OF EYES</strong>
<br>
My family drove 7 hours round trip to visit me at IRONMAN Louisville. They had never experienced an IRONMAN race before and it was a special moment to witness their reactions to the spirit of IRONMAN for the first time. Seeing my family overcome with wonderment and excitement as they snaked through the large crowds, heard the cheers of spectators, and watched the choreographed dance of athletes and volunteers in T1 was a moment of reignited inspiration for me.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_7156-e1450818467174-1024x664.jpg">
<br>
<strong>2) GREAT THINGS HAPPEN WHEN I FORGET ABOUT “ME”</strong>
<br>
I had been on the road for the past 2 weeks, I almost had to check the bags under my eyes as extra luggage, my email inbox was over flowing, our hotel room looked like a set from The Shining, and part of our shipment we needed for race week was missing. I was stuck in a “me” spiral as we headed to an IRONMAN Foundation service project at a center that cared for adults with special needs. Once we arrived, I stopped thinking about “me” and focused on listening to others. I heard excitement when the participants gushed over outfits for the formal dance they were attending the following night. I heard cheers when one of the participants hit a softball for the first time. I heard laughter and high-fives. When I forgot about me, I was present in the moment and could fully appreciate the gift of making another person smile.<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_7031-1024x683.jpg">
<br>
<strong>1) THIS FEELING NEVER GETS OLD</strong>
<br>
I have traveled to dozens of races and am still inspired by the energy of race morning and the excitement of a finish line. I still tear up when athletes are overcome with emotion as they accomplish a huge life goal and my heart hurts when an athlete’s race day doesn’t go as planned. I am humbled and in awe of everything that our TEAM IMF teammates have and will continue to accomplish and am appreciative for what they have taught me about IRONMAN, life, and resiliency in 2015.<br>

<strong>IRONMAN Arizona: </strong>

</p>
<p>When athletes imagine their race day at IRONMAN Arizona, persistent rain and chilly temperatures are the last thing on everyone’s mind. Yet, there we were…it was race day in Tempe and folks were trying to stay dry (and warm) any way they could. Black garbage bags may be catching on as the new IRONMAN “trend” on the course. Despite the unfortunate weather, athletes were putting out amazing times &amp; PR’s all over the place, whether they were first-timers or seasoned IRONMAN veterans.</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation was lucky enough to witness nearly <em>
<strong>400</strong>
</em> Foundation Athletes cross the finish line on Sunday, now that is incredible! 85 of these athletes were part of <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/" target="_blank">TEAM IMF</a>, which fundraised over $285,000 (WOW) for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Another 300 were those that had purchased a <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/foundation-slots/" target="_blank">Community Fund Entry</a> which covers their race entry, as well as provides a tax-deductible donation to The IRONMAN Foundation. As our last race of the season (as well as our biggest), IRONMAN Foundation Staff and the community of Tempe, AZ had a busy week in front of them.</p>
<p>Read on to get the inside scoop on all the fun IRONMAN Foundation Athletes, and staff, had in Tempe last week!</p>

<p>Starting on Thursday, The IRONMAN Foundation greeted athletes, spectators, and volunteers at their booth in the IRONMAN Village in Tempe, AZ. We had a blast thanking all of our Foundation Athletes and sharing the incredible giveback stories made possible by The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund.</p>

</p>
<p>On Friday, 4 inspiring athletes were invited to be on a panel hosted by Mike Reilly. Mike picked their brains on what makes them race for a cause during their IRONMAN Journey. It was a great experience to hear stories from TEAM IMF Athlete: Marc Friend, YJYC Athlete: Tom Richter, Smile Train Charity Partner Athlete: Jeffrey Krebs, and IMF|NR Tri Team Athlete: Peter Anderson.</p>

<p>Throughout the week, IRONMAN Athletes stopped by The IRONMAN Foundation’s booth in IRONMAN Village to write thank you cards to volunteers. These handwritten thank you cards were delivered to volunteer groups on race day and they loved them!</p>
<p>

<p>Some athletes wrote lighthearted messages…and some opt for a more serious tone.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Situated on the breezy oasis of Panama City Beach, IRONMAN Florida is a favorite among many IRONMAN Athletes for its flat &amp; fast course. The week leading up to race day brought higher than normal temperatures, as well as some intense humidity, which was a big turn-around from the freezing temps in 2014. But we didn’t let a little dose of heat get in the way of us having a great time meeting all of our 375 <em>amazing</em> IRONMAN Foundation Athletes!<br>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12193856_10106866625359583_882622062581352943_n-e1447269593737.jpg">
</p>
<p>At IRONMAN Florida, we had a <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/" target="_blank">TEAM IMF</a> presence of 25 athletes strong that helped raise over $85,000 in support of The IRONMAN Foundation and our race communties. Now THAT is awesome. These philanthropic athletes wanted to dedicate their race to giving back, and supporting the communities that support us on race day. With a commitment to raise $3,000, TEAM IMF Athletes received a free entry into IRONMAN Florida, as well as some super cool custom swag, a team luncheon, and other great perks!</p>
<p>Also present at IRONMAN Florida were over 350 Foundation Athletes that supported The IRONMAN Foundation and IRONMAN race communities through their purchase of a <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/foundation-slots/" target="_blank">Community Fund</a> entry into IRONMAN Florida. Theses Community Fund Entries are double the typical registration fee. Half of this registration is then given to The IRONMAN Foundation as a tax-deductible donation, and the other half is kept for your race fees.</p>
<p>Keep reading for some insight into what went on behind the scenes with our IRONMAN Foundation Staff and Athletes during race week in PCB!</p>

<p>On Thursday of race week, we held a luncheon for our amazing TEAM IMF Athletes that dedicated their IRONMAN Journey to giving back to our race communities. We had a blast getting to meet everyone!</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation, in conjunction with The Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, presented the Panama City Beach Fire Rescue Team with a $20,000 grant check to buy 2 Jaws of Life that will help save many lives in the region. Prior to this grant, PCB had no Jaws of Life in the area.</p>
<p>

The IRONMAN Foundation® will facilitate over $81,000 in charitable giveback to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Tempe, Arizona community in conjunction with the 2015 IRONMAN® Arizona triathlon presented by Waste Management taking place on Sunday, November 15, 2015. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<em>
<strong>Community Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $10,000 community grant to the Salt River Community Children’s Foundation to meet the needs of underserved tribal youth in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in the areas of health, education, and general welfare. “We have helped youth who may not be otherwise served to participate in programs or activities their parents may not have been able to afford without the IRONMAN Foundation’s help,” said Chairman Robert Scabby. “For example, we have helped the Salt River High School and Elementary School partner with the Phoenix Symphony in a year-long, music education residency program. We have also helped the Youth Services program implement a Club-Fit program–a catalyst for developing positive, healthy children lifestyles.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Tempe community with this community grant award.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s grant recipients at the Athlete Welcome Ceremony at 6:30 p.m. on Friday, November 13, 2015 at Tempe Beach Park.<br>

<strong>Volunteer Grants</strong>

</span>
<br>
Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide an additional $55,000 in volunteer grant donations this year for both the IRONMAN Arizona &amp; 70.3 events. “We are thrilled to expand The IRONMAN Foundation’s reach and impact through volunteer grants in the Tempe region,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 36 community groups in the region.</p>

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will also provide two additional grants to benefit first responder groups within the Tempe region. The first is a $3,285.09 grant to the Tempe Police Department to purchase standard National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) equipment for their detectives working on active arson crime scenes. “Tempe police respond alongside Tempe firefighters to dozens of criminally-set arson fires in our community annually,” said Tempe Asst. Chief Angel Carbajal. “Thanks to the generosity of our partners at Ironman and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, this grant award will help keep our arson detectives safe in these hazardous environments. The personal protective equipment will facilitate the soonest entry of detectives into the crime scene alongside firefighters, to more quickly obtain evidence crucial to the investigation and arrest of the suspect, enhancing public safety across our community.”</p>
<p>The second grant of $12,965 will be awarded to the Mesa Fire and Rescue Department for the purpose of purchasing an I-STAT distribution kit. “The I-STAT will enhance the Mesa Fire and Medical Department’s community paramedicine programs by giving our providers the ability to do in-home lab testing to diagnose and monitor patients while coordinating with a patient’s physician to improve treatment decisions and health outcomes,” said Deputy Chief Steve Ward. “Fire-based community paramedicine is an emerging grassroots practice delivered through Mesa Fire and Medical Department paramedics and our community partners aimed at better efficiency in patient care, helping communities become healthier, and reduced costs within healthcare system delivery. “</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”<br>

TEAM IMF is The IRONMAN Foundation’s fundraising triathlon team. Team members have the opportunity to race in the IRONMAN event of their choice when they commit to raise $3,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Athletes participating in this program through the 2015 IRONMAN Arizona triathlon have raised over $273,000, while collectively all of The Foundation’s TEAM IMF athletes have raised over $930,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund in 2015.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. Smile Train is the Featured Charity Partner of the 2015 IRONMAN Arizona triathlon. With 130 athletes racing at IRONMAN Arizona, Team EMPOWER is on track to raise a record-setting $800,000 to provide free surgeries for those suffering from cleft lip and palate around the world. Since beginning in 2013, Team EMPOWER athletes have helped 9,600 children and have a network of over 600 alumni. “Knowing that I have helped to bring new smiles into this world makes me happy! Who doesn’t love to see a child smile?,” said Team EMPOWER alumni ambassador Jeff Krebs. “Being on Team EMPOWER motivates me to do my best while training and racing. I am reminded that I am doing this for others rather than just for myself.”</p>
<p>Partnering with an IRONMAN® or IRONMAN 70.3® event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission. Through these partnerships, $6,722,715 was raised to support their respective missions in 2014 alone, and $13.4 million since the beginning of The IRONMAN Foundation’s charity partnership program.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation also provides registered athletes with the platform to fundraise for The Foundation or a non-profit beneficiary of their choice as they train for their IRONMAN event. These athletes have signed up to participate in The IRONMAN Foundation’s “Your Journey, Your Cause” fundraising program. Through their participation with The Foundation, these athletes are racing for something greater than themselves, and are giving back to non-profit organizations to make their race experiences more than just crossing the finish line – they are racing for a cause. Several of these athletes will tell their incredible stories during the athlete panel taking place at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 13 at Tempe Beach Park. Collectively, all of The Foundation’s Your Journey, Your Cause athletes have raised over $437,000 for their respective causes in 2015.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation® Community Fund will distribute $45,000 in grant funding to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Panama City Beach, Florida community in conjunction with the 2015 IRONMAN® Florida triathlon taking place on Saturday, November 7, 2015. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>
<p>

<strong>Community Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $6,200 community grant to the City of Panama City Beach Parks &amp; Recreation Department, as well as a $2,993 community grant to the Panama City Police Department. The City of Panama City Beach Parks &amp; Recreation Department will utilize their community grant to purchase a handicap-accessible water foundation and bottle filling station for their Emerald Coast Miracle League Field, which is a baseball league for individuals ages three and up who have special needs. They will also construct an enclosure to receive Gopher Tortoises at the Panama City Beach Conservation Park, enhancing educational opportunities about this endangered species within the region.</p>
<p>The Panama City Police Department will use their grant funding for the purchase of 100 self-rescue tourniquets, which act as a compression device to control blood flow around a wounded limb, therefore allowing police officers to restrict blood loss during compromising situations. “This grant provides funding for much needed life sustaining equipment,” said Panama City Police Deputy Chief Tom McCarthy. “Without this grant, they would be without this equipment and the likelihood of loss of life would be significantly increased.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Panama City Beach community with these community grant awards.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will recognize this year’s community grant recipients at the Athlete Welcome Banquet at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 5, 2015 at the Boardwalk Beach Resort.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will also provide an additional grant of $19,998 to Panama City Beach Fire Rescue to purchase two Hurst Jaws of Life® combination tools that will be placed on rapid response trucks to aid in extricating patients in medical accidents. “Our department is very understaffed, so we actually utilize pickup trucks to respond to medical and vehicle incidents,” said Larry Couch, Deputy Fire Chief of Panama City Beach Fire Rescue. “These two tools will provide those Paramedics and EMTs with the necessary equipment for vehicle extrications and also provide firefighter protection at fire incidents as these firefighters/paramedics are used for rapid intervention crews for firefighter rescue if needed”.</p>
<p>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</p>

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation has worked with many non-profit organizations in the form of charity partnerships throughout the years. The Children’s Tumor Foundation is the Featured Charity Partner of the 2015 IRONMAN Florida triathlon. With almost 140 athletes racing at IRONMAN Florida, The Children’s Tumor Foundation NF Endurance team is on track to raise $300,000 for raising awareness and research funds to find a cure for NF (neurofibromatosis). “These athletes are helping us to further our mission to end NF,” said Angela Earle, Community &amp; Youth Events Manager for the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Just a five years ago, we only had 5 clinical trials for NF. Today, there are 26. Because of these athletes we are able to give those living with NF, hope. Hope that one day there will be effective treatments that will lead to a cure.”</p>
<p>Partnering with an IRONMAN® or IRONMAN 70.3® event provides a platform for charities to raise awareness and educate others about their cause while raising valuable funds towards their mission.

</a>Move for Hunger</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation will continue a partnership with the national non-profit organization Move For Hunger at IRONMAN Florida in order to fill our nation’s food banks. In an effort to give back to the local community, The IRONMAN Foundation has agreed to donate leftover food from select races throughout the United States to neighborhood food banks. By teaming up with moving companies, Move For Hunger arranges pickup and delivery directly from the event to the local food bank. With moving trucks and forklifts, the movers devote their free time by volunteering for the non-profit organization.<br>
“We are beyond excited about the partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation for these select races,” said Adam Lowy, Move For Hunger Executive Director. “Not only is IRONMAN making a big impact in the fight against hunger, the food donated is of high nutritional value, great for those who are malnourished.” One in six Americans, including 17 million children, are considered food insecure. Through this partnership, Move For Hunger and The IRONMAN Foundation have transported a total of 37,747 pounds of food thus far for delivery to those in need this year.</p>

<strong>KENTUCKY</strong> – The state known for its Bourbon &amp; BBQ proudly claims Louisville as its own. An eclectic, bustling city with southern roots, beautiful fall weather, and a love for IRONMAN Athletes, Louisville proved that October really is the perfect time for an IRONMAN in Kentucky. On an idealic Sunday in October, over 100 IRONMAN Foundation Athletes persevered through one of the most grueling endurance sports to hear their name, and the words “You are an IRONMAN!”, called out as they crossed the finish line. <img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7090-1024x768.jpg">
</p>
<p>60 of these athletes were <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/" target="_blank">TEAM IMF Athletes</a>, who committed to fundraising for The IRONMAN Foundation in exchange for their guaranteed race entry into IRONMAN Louisville. Collectively, these teammates raised almost $215,000 that will be donated back into IRONMAN race communities!</p>
<p>Another 50 Foundation Athletes racing at IRONMAN Louisville purchase a <a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/foundation-slots/" target="_blank">Community Fund Entry</a> at registration for double the registration fee, in which half of that registration is a tax-deductible donation to The IRONMAN Foundation. These donations also help to provide the over $1.5 Million that will be distributed to various non-profits and charitable organizations throughout 51 race communities in 2015.<br>

<p>Not only was The IRONMAN Foundation able to provide monetary support to dozens of non-profits and charitable organizations, but Foundation Athletes were able to visit one beneficiary, The Harbor House of Louisville, where they could physically see the positive impact they were making. The Harbor House provides daily programming for adults with physical and mental disabilities.</p>

<strong>Summary of the service project:</strong> The IRONMAN Athletes admitted they may have had more fun that the folks from The Harbor House did. With a dance coming up the next night, many of The Harbor House ladies wanted their nails painted. Whitney stepped up to the challenge! Our Foundation Athletes showed such amazing compassion throughout our time at The Harbor House.</p>

The IRONMAN Foundation<sup>®</sup> Community Fund provided a $90,000 donation to the Navy SEAL Foundation this past weekend as part of the IRONMAN<sup>® </sup>70.3<sup>®</sup> SUPERFROG triathlon in Coronado, California that served as a charity fundraising race. The IRONMAN Foundation race entries were available to athletes participating in the event, with $200 from each of those entries serving as a tax-deductible donation towards The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund.</p>
<p>“The birth of IRONMAN started with U.S. Naval Commander John Collins and wife, Judy, issuing a challenge to combine the 2.4-mile Waikiki Roughwater Swim with 112 miles of the Around-O’ahu Bike Race, followed by a 26.2-mile run on the same course as the Honolulu Marathon. In 1978, 15 competitors embraced the challenge and the world’s most demanding and iconic endurance race began,” said Andrew Messick, Chief Executive Officer for IRONMAN. “We are humbled to go back to our military roots with this incredible event and are honored to have The IRONMAN Foundation make this donation to the Navy SEAL Foundation and give back to those who serve our nation every day.”</p>
<p>The Navy SEAL Foundation’s mission is to provide immediate and ongoing support and assistance to the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community, their families, and the families of the fallen, wounded and also transitioning NSW veterans. U.S. Navy SEALs have been in sustained combat for over 13 years, performing hazardous work in unforgiving environments at an unrelenting pace. SEALs are currently deployed in over 35 countries across the globe and spend up to 270 days each year in harm’s way. The Navy SEAL Foundation stands behind these warriors and their families by delivering comprehensive, world-class programs that specifically address the community’s unique needs.</p>
<p>“Intense training, physical strength, mental toughness and the desire to finish — IRONMAN athletes and Navy SEALs share a natural kinship,” said Robin King, CEO, Navy SEAL Foundation.  “IRONMAN continues to be an inspiring partner committed to supporting Navy SEAL warriors and their families. This contribution has a direct impact on our capacity to serve our community in times of achievement, adversity and greatest sacrifice.”</p>
<p>“The IRONMAN Foundation is able to provide givebacks to support causes in communities where we hold our IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events. We are able to do so through the generosity of our athletes who contribute to our community fund,” said David Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The city of Chattanooga is a great host to our athletes as they tackle the 140.6 (+4) at IM CHOO. The swim is fast, the run is hilly, and the volunteers/spectators are some of the best on the circuit. The IRONMAN Foundation had an amazing week supporting 300 of our Foundation Athletes as they chased their IRONMAN dreams.</p>
<p>We had 3 types of Foundation Athletes at IRONMAN Chattanooga:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman/chattanooga/register/ironman-foundation.aspx#axzz3n8je9gAm" target="_blank">Community Fund Entry</a> – Athletes purchased this entry at registration and a portion of their entry was donation made directly to The IRONMAN Foundation.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ironmanfoundation.org/programs/team-imf/" target="_blank">TEAM IMF Teammates</a> – Athletes who committed to fundraise for The IRONMAN Foundation and, in return, received guaranteed race entry into IRONMAN Chattanooga.</li>
<li>IMF/Newton Running Ambassadors – Athletes who champion service through sport and do it all in Newton Running Shoes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, we provided OVER $80,000 in grant funding back into charitable organizations within the community that supports IMCHOO. This is part of an over $155,000 TOTAL giveback since 2014!</p>
<p>Check out exclusive Behind-The-Scenes Pictures of our staff and athletes throughout race week – Hope you can join us in 2016!</p>

<strong>THURSDAY – 72 HOURS UNTIL RACE DAY: </strong>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chattanooga was lucky enough to host over 300 IRONMAN Foundation Athletes last week, with many of those being a part of our IRONMAN Foundation-Newton Running Ambassador Triathlon Team, and our TEAM IMF Fundraising Team. The great thing about these guys is not only do they dedicate hours &amp; hours each week to IRONMAN Training, but they have a passion for giving back to their race communities through service and fundraising. Thursday morning, we had about 30 IRONMAN Foundation Athletes dedicate their morning to perform a service project at The Chattanooga Area Food Bank, which feeds over 50,000 families each week. Not only did they come out and lend a hand for a few hours…they raised over $26,000 to donate to the Food Bank as well!</p>

<strong>FRIDAY: 48 HOURS UNTIL RACE DAY</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rain seems to follow the IMF Staff wherever we go…we had a few wet &amp; soggy days out at IRONMAN Village in Chattanooga. But, that didn’t stop us from having a blast out there getting to know Foundation Athletes &amp; our awesome volunteers. Friday was a big day for The IRONMAN Foundation- our TEAM IMF Athletes got together for a pre-race luncheon to celebrate their fundraising success and learn some tips &amp; tricks for race day. Luckily, the rain let up for the Athlete Welcome Ceremony on Friday evening where we presented a $10,000 to SPARC, a chapter of DSUSA, which they will use to purchase equipment to allow their athletes to race in handcycling &amp; wheelchair racing competitions. The IRONMAN Foundation also presented a check to the Chattanooga Mayor for $45,000 that will be distributed to non-profit initiatives in Chattanooga.</p>

<strong>THANK YOU VOLUNTEERS</strong>

<p>One of The IRONMAN Foundation’s “Pass-It-Forward” Initiatives was having athletes write Thank You notes to IRONMAN Volunteers that were then passed out on race day. This was such a great way for the athletes to show appreciation for our IRONMAN Volunteers that are out there all day supporting the athletes. Without their incredible support, race day would not happen!</p>

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation® Community Fund will distribute $60,000 in grant funding to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Louisville, Kentucky community in conjunction with the 2015 IRONMAN® Louisville triathlon presented by Norton Sports Health taking place on Sunday, October 11, 2015. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. With this most recent donation from The IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $540,000 has been given back to the Louisville community since the race began in 2007. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<em>
<strong>Community Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $10,000 community grant to the Louisville Sports Commission to support the funding of sporting events within the community, and another $10,000 community grant will be awarded to the Oldham County Fiscal Court to fund its participation initiatives for its sprint triathlon as well as to support youth-based athletic programs in Oldham County.</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Louisville community with these community grant awards.”</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation and Community Grant recipients will be recognized at the Athlete Welcome Dinner at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, October 9, 2015 at the Kentucky International Convention Center.<br>

<em>
<strong>Volunteer Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide an additional $40,000 in volunteer grant donations. “We are thrilled to expand The IRONMAN Foundation’s reach and impact through volunteer grants in the Louisville community,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 25 community groups in the region.<br>

</a>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<em>
<strong>Team IMF</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
TEAM IMF is The IRONMAN Foundation’s fundraising triathlon team. Team members have the opportunity to race in the IRONMAN event of their choice when they commit to raise $3,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund. Athletes participating in this program through the 2015 IRONMAN Louisville triathlon presented by Norton Sports Health have raised over $176,000, while collectively all of The Foundation’s TEAM IMF athletes have raised over $795,000 for The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund in 2015.</p>

<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation also provides registered athletes with the platform to fundraise for The Foundation or a non-profit beneficiary of their choice as they train for their IRONMAN event. These athletes have signed up to participate in The IRONMAN Foundation’s “Your Journey, Your Cause” fundraising program.

<em>
<u>Move for Hunger<br>
</u>
</em>
</strong>The IRONMAN Foundation will continue a partnership with the national non-profit organization Move For Hunger at IRONMAN Louisville in order to fill our nation’s food banks. In an effort to give back to the local community, The IRONMAN Foundation has agreed to donate leftover food from select races throughout the United States to neighborhood food banks. By teaming up with moving companies, Move For Hunger arranges pickup and delivery directly from the event to the local food bank. With moving trucks and forklifts, the movers devote their free time by volunteering for the non-profit organization.</p>
<p>“We are beyond excited about the partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation for these select races,” said Adam Lowy, Move For Hunger Executive Director. “Not only is IRONMAN making a big impact in the fight against hunger, the food donated is of high nutritional value, great for those who are malnourished.” One in six Americans, including 17 million children, are considered food insecure. Move For Hunger and The IRONMAN Foundation have partnered in 5 other race communities in 2014 and 2015, transporting a total of over 105,000 pounds of food for delivery to those in need.</p>

</a>The IRONMAN Foundation® Community Fund will distribute $35,000 in grant funding to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Cambridge, Maryland community in conjunction with the 2015 IRONMAN® Maryland presented by Transamerica triathlon taking place on Saturday, October 4, 2015. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. With this most recent donation from The IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $96,000 has been given back to the Cambridge community for both IRONMAN Maryland and IRONMAN 70.3 Eagleman events. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>

<strong>Community Grants</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $10,000 community grant to the Dorchester County YMCA, who will use the funding to purchase a vehicle that will assist in making their youth programs more accessible in a community that has little to no access to public transportation. Dorchester County YMCA CEO JoAnn Hansen shared, “We live in community where oftentimes parents and grandparents simply cannot or do not have access or the ability to transport their children to and from the Y. We are so grateful to IRONMAN for supporting opportunities to keep kids active and engaged in YMCA activities that provide kids with a safe place…a place to belong…a place where they can learn, grow and thrive while under the watchful eyes and nurturing care of trained staff.” Steve Culver, Board member of the Dorchester County YMCA and past participant of IRONMAN Maryland and IRONMAN Lake Placid, also commented, “As an IRONMAN athlete, I understand how important a host community is to an athlete’s overall IRONMAN experience and to achieving their race goals. The support and commitment Dorchester County showed to the IRONMAN athletes last year was simply amazing, and the support has only gotten better this year. This grant from the IRONMAN Foundation is just another example of how they give back to support the needs of local communities.”</p>
<p>“Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Cambridge community with these community grant awards.”<br>

<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation® Community Fund will distribute $65,000 in grant funding to non-profit initiatives and groups in the greater Madison, Wisconsin community in conjunction with the 2015 IRONMAN® Wisconsin triathlon taking place on Sunday, September 13, 2015. The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN® events are held. With this most recent donation from The IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $879,000 has been given back to the Madison community since the race began in 2002. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</h4>

<strong>Community Grants</strong>
</em>
</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local non-profit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support The Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $35,000 community grant to the Madison Area Sports Commission (MASC) to support their youth grant initiative, which provides support to organizations that serve adolescents under the age of seventeen throughout Dane County. “Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Madison community with these community grant awards.”</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation/MASC partnership will be recognized at the Athlete Welcome Ceremony at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, September 11, 2015 at the Monona Terrace Exhibition Hall.</h4>

<strong>Volunteer Grants</strong>
</em>
</h4>
<h4>Within IRONMAN’s race communities, The IRONMAN Foundation provides a grant program to support organizations that have a volunteerism component. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide an additional $30,000 in volunteer grant donations. “We are thrilled to expand The IRONMAN Foundation’s reach and impact through volunteer grants in the Madison community,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 41 community groups in the region.</h4>

<strong>Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation</strong>
</em>
</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation, in partnership with the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation (FHSPSF), will also provide an additional grant of over $18,700 to the Madison Police Department. This donation will be used to purchase 13 powered air-purifying respirators, which will allow police offers to operate more effectively for longer periods of time in critical situations. “The Madison Police Department greatly appreciates this support from Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation and The IRONMAN Foundation,” said Madison Police Department Chief Mike Koval. “This equipment will allow us to serve the community more safely and effectively, and further demonstrates the great partnership between the city and IRONMAN.”</h4>
<h4>“Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, along with The IRONMAN Foundation, is grateful for the opportunity to give back to those who loyally serve our communities,” said Robin Peters, Executive Director of FHSPSF. “As IRONMAN athletes prove that ‘Anything is Possible,’ we feel that the mantra also represents what can be done to support the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others.”</h4>

<em>
<strong>Move for Hunger</strong>
</em>
</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation will continue a partnership with the national non-profit organization Move For Hunger at this year’s IRONMAN Wisconsin triathlon in order to fill our nation’s food banks. In an effort to give back to the local community, The IRONMAN Foundation has agreed to donate leftover food from select races throughout the United States to neighborhood food banks. By teaming up with moving companies, Move For Hunger arranges pickup and delivery directly from the event to the local food bank. With moving trucks and forklifts, the movers devote their free time by volunteering for the non-profit organization.</h4>
<h4>“We are beyond excited about the partnership with the IRONMAN Foundation for these select races,” said Adam Lowy, Move For Hunger Executive Director. “Not only is IRONMAN making a big impact in the fight against hunger, the food donated is of high nutritional value, great for those who are malnourished.” One in six Americans, including 17 million children, are considered food insecure. Move For Hunger and The IRONMAN Foundation have partnered in five other race communities in 2014 and 2015, transporting a total of over 105,000 pounds of food for delivery to those in need.</h4>

<em>
<strong>Your Journey, Your Cause</strong>
</em>
</h4>
<h4>The IRONMAN Foundation also provides registered athletes with the platform to fundraise for The Foundation or a non-profit beneficiary of their choice as they train for their IRONMAN event. These athletes have signed up to participate in The IRONMAN Foundation’s “Your Journey, Your Cause” fundraising program. Through their participation with The Foundation, these athletes are racing for something greater than themselves, and are giving back to non-profit organizations to make their race experiences more than just crossing the finish line – they are racing for a cause. Several of these athletes will tell their incredible stories during the athlete panel taking place at 12:00 p.m. noon on Friday, September 11 in the IRONMAN Village. Collectively, all of The Foundation’s Your Journey, Your Cause athletes have raised over $280,000 for their respective causes in 2015.</h4>

<![CDATA[<p>IRONMAN Lake Placid never fails to be a great race. The community, athletes, and volunteers all rally together to make an incredible atmosphere filled with inspiration and support. The race may be over but the impact from IRONMAN Foundation Athletes is still going strong! This year, IRONMAN Foundation Athletes gave back $66,000 in grant funding to local nonprofit groups within the Adirondack region.</p>
<p>244 Foundation Athletes toed the line at IRONMAN Lake Placid this past Sunday. These amazing triathletes purchased a community fund entry that provided a donation to The IRONMAN Foundation as part of their registration process.</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>YOU GOT RAK’d!</strong>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation went rogue throughout the week leading up to IRONMAN Lake Placid. We started with small “pay-it-forward” initiatives like paying for the coffee/ice cream of a random stranger. Instead of getting a receipt they would receive a “RAK” card that encouraged them to extend the kindness to another.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_55191-e1438201060963-1024x553.jpg">
</p>
<p>In addition to these small acts, athletes/volunteers/spectators who stopped by The IRONMAN Foundation booth in the IRONMAN Village were encouraged to jot handwritten “Thank You” cards to volunteers or “Good Luck” cards to athletes.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The “Good Luck” cards were then handed out randomly to athletes at bike check-in on Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation provides charitable support to a variety of local nonprofit organizations that recognize citizens in need and support the Foundation’s mission. The Foundation works with community leaders to identify projects and initiatives and to provide funding in order to support worthwhile causes. This year, The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a $10,000 community grant to Paradox Sports, who will use the funds to serve 40 veterans, civilians, and youth with disabilities in life-changing, perception-shattering adventures in the outdoors climbing rock and ice, and on adaptive mountain and river expeditions.  Executive Director, Doug Sandok, said “The grant from the Ironman Foundation aligns well with our mission and directly supports our life changing programming. Paradox Sports not only supports individuals in discovering what they are capable of, but also creates adaptive sport communities that include people with disabilities and other able bodied individuals. By creating these powerful inclusive communities we are exploding preconceived notions of what someone with a disability is capable of. We create bridges and bonds in the outdoor community for our veterans, creating a holistic approach to changing people’s perceptions of difference and possibility. We are proud to be partnering with the Ironman Foundation in creating that positive change. The multisport community has always been about breaking through perceived limits and challenging the possible and that attitude aligns closely with our own. Thank you to the Ironman Foundation for supporting the mission and work of Paradox Sports.”</p>

It is about IRONMAN, our partners and athletes making a difference in our race communities through the sport of triathlon.”  The athletes on the team have raised $14,500 which will be donated to the Boulder Bridge House, which creates a culture of opportunity for Boulder’s homeless and working poor.</p>

These athletes have been touched by something greater than themselves and are giving back to non-profit organizations to make their race experiences more than just crossing the finish line – they are racing for a cause. Athletes participating in this program through IRONMAN Boulder have raised over $17,000, while collectively all of the Foundation’s Your Journey, Your Cause athletes have raised over $200,000 for their respective causes in 2015.<br>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund will give $66,000 in grant funding to initiatives and groups in the greater Lake Placid, New York area as part of the IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> Lake Placid triathlon taking place on Sunday, July 26, 2015. The IRONMAN Lake Placid event is one of the oldest and most prestigious of the IRONMAN events in North America.  The IRONMAN Foundation’s contribution will provide support to non-profit needs and initiatives within the local community, and brings the total giveback to $1,377,033 in the region. Including the IRONMAN Foundation donations as part of IRONMAN Lake Placid, a total of over $1.5 million will be provided to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities in 2015.</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will donate $26,000 of the $66,000 to the Lake Placid community to support local non-profit beneficiaries that will use the funds toward initiatives to better the area. One recipient of these funds is the Lake Placid Outing Club (LPOC). David Balestrini, Board Chair of LPOC, said “Support from the Ironman Foundation Inc. will be used to directly further our mission. We will be able to include a larger percentage of disadvantage youth in our program, train an additional leader to continue offering highly subsidized, multiple-overnight wilderness trips, and continue the ongoing effort to maintain and diversify the equipment we make available to participants in our program.” Other grant recipients include the Adirondack Foundation, East Branch Friends of the Arts, and the Adirondack Medical Center.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IM-LP-Swim-2-300x168.jpg">
</p>
<p>Community grant recipients will be honored at the Athlete Welcome Ceremony on Friday, July 24, 2015 at Mid’s Park on Main Street, Lake Placid.</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will provide $40,000 in grant donations to local non-profit groups that have a volunteerism component to their organizations.  “The mission of the IRONMAN Foundation is to leave the IRONMAN legacy through philanthropy, volunteerism and grant making, and to support various public benefit organizations around the world.  We are thrilled to expand the Foundation’s reach and impact through volunteer grants in Lake Placid,” said Christine Perkins, Community Relations Manager for The IRONMAN Foundation.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://ironmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IM-LP-Smile-300x168.jpg">
</p>
<p>More than 229 athletes registered as Foundation athletes for IRONMAN Lake Placid, which generated $166,025 for the Foundation’s Community Fund.  This fund provides volunteer and community grant support to public benefit organizations and programs within IRONMAN race communities throughout the United States.  The proceeds from the Community Fund then provide grant opportunities to public benefit organizations in the communities where U.S. IRONMAN events are held.</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation will be conducting a R.A.K. (Random Acts of Kindness) campaign while in Lake Placid.  The foundation staff will be out and about throughout the community encouraging athletes and their support crew to make a difference while out in the community.  To find out more information on how to get involved with the foundations programs, stop by their expo boot at the IRONMAN expo at the Olympic Oval from Thursday through Saturday.</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation Community Fund provides community and volunteer grant opportunities to non-profit organizations where U.S. IRONMAN<sup>®</sup> events are held. With the 2015 donations from The IRONMAN Foundation, a total of $635,000 has been given since the first IRONMAN Coeur d’Alene event in 2003. In 2015, The IRONMAN Foundation will provide more than $1.5 million to support the needs of IRONMAN race communities across North America.</p>

<strong>COMMUNITY GRANTS</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will provide a total of $25,000 in community grants which are given to local non-profit beneficiaries that will use the funds toward initiatives to better the Coeur d’Alene area. “Grant funding is one way that The IRONMAN Foundation leaves a lasting legacy in the communities where IRONMAN races take place,” said Dave Deschenes, Executive Director of The IRONMAN Foundation. “We are thrilled to support the Coeur d’Alene community with these community grant awards.”</p>
<p>One recipient of these funds is the City of Coeur d’Alene Recreation Department, which will support programs and provide activities that help fight obesity and maintain healthy lifestyles at no cost to program participants. Another recipient is The Salvation Army Ray &amp; Joan Kroc Corps Community Center for its Third Grade Swim program, which helps hundreds of local students learn critical water safety skills and swim basics. “The 2015 IRONMAN Foundation grant allows us to discount fees to only $5 per student, reduced from the actual cost average of $22 per student. This allows the participation of children who had previously been unable to afford the program,” said Christy Markham, Development Director from The Salvation Army Kroc Center. “This effort makes Third Grade Swim accessible to those who most need it, allowing 1,096 students to participate in the 2015 program, up from 990 students in 2014.”</p>

<p>The IRONMAN Foundation’s Community Fund will also provide an additional $35,000 in grant donations to local non-profit groups that have a volunteerism component to their organizations. Last year, volunteer grant funding was distributed among 38 community groups and organizations in and around the Coeur d’Alene region through the volunteer grant program.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The IRONMAN Foundation will donate $50,000 to The Woodlands community to support local non-profit beneficiaries that will use the funds towards initiatives to better the area. One recipient of these funds is Meals on Wheels Montgomery County, a local organization that will use their $10,000 grant to increase homebound meal deliveries to seniors not currently being served.  Allison Hulett, Executive Director, said “Meals on Wheels Montgomery County currently serves 450 homebound seniors with a nutritious meal every day.  These are the elderly among us that otherwise could not procure a meal for themselves. With that said, we still have a waiting list of approximately 200 disabled seniors needing our services to continue to age in place in their homes, where they want to stay.  We are grateful that The IRONMAN Foundation will allow our organization to deliver 5,460 meals to needy seniors over the next 12 months!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other community grant recipients include Education for Tomorrow Alliance, Montgomery County Youth Services, Angel Reach and the Boy Scouts of America – George Strake District Chapter. All of the community grant recipients will be honored at the Athlete Welcome Banquet on Thursday, May 14, 2014 at 5:30 p.m. at the Marriott Hotel.</p>

</a>In yet another initiative, The IRONMAN Foundation Newton Running Ambassador Triathlon Team, in its third year of existence, will be giving back in The Woodlands, Texas. The goal of the team is to have athletes share the concept of “service through sport and commitment to community.”  The Foundation and Newton Running recruited athletes from across North America to represent the team and share the goodwill of giving back to race communities. Twenty members will be representing the team in Texas, and have identified Interfaith of the Woodlands as the beneficiary of a hands-on service project and the fundraising efforts of their team.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Shay was severely burned at the age of eight, with burns and burn-related scarring covering over 65% of his body. As a result of the intense scarring, his right arm became webbed to his side, physically preventing his arm from lifting higher than a 45 degree angle. The right side of Shay’s neck suffered the same webbing effect and was permanently affixed at a 60 degree angle. It took over 3 years of physical therapy, multiple skin graft procedures and the wearing of pressure fitting braces to regain a majority of his mobility. He was initially hospitalized for three months and lost his right ear to gangrene. Shay has incurred over 30 surgeries spanning the last 30 years of his life. He was told it would be extremely challenging to ever play physical sports due to scar tissue and nerve damage suffered.</p>
<p>As testament to his will to succeed, Shay was an All American High School wrestler, 3-time boxing champion in college and is a nationally ranked triathlete. He competed in the IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii in 2012, and completed the race in 10 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Shay says “I believe people are capable of so much more than most achieve and hope that I can inspire others to not become complacent with their life. I believe in leaving behind a legacy and changing the lives of others around me.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, Shay is a happily married father of 5 children under the age of 7!</p>

<h3>One man’s sobering journey through IRONMAN. by Lisa Dobear</h3>
<p>When 38-year-old Richard Alamo talks about going into “survival mode,” he isn’t referring to the grueling 140.6 miles it takes to get to an IRONMAN finish line. For the four-time IRONMAN finisher, survival mode used to be a 30-pack of beer and a couch.</p>
<p>“Before IRONMAN racing, I was just surviving,” he says. “I experienced so many traumatic events in my youth. My grandmother raised me, and at one point we were homeless. She passed away when I was 14, and I found myself alone with nowhere to go. I lived in the streets and I started drinking.” For most of his life, surviving was all Alamo knew how to do.</p>
<p>In an attempt to deal with his emotions, the Elk Grove, Calif. firefighter turned to marathons, but couldn’t outrun his demons. “When a fellow firefighter was training for a sprint triathlon, I thought it might be time for me to try something else. In 2008, I found an Olympic distance race in East Los Angeles, where I grew up, and decided to <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="background-color: transparent !important; border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background-position: initial initial !important; background-repeat: initial initial !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Cinema-Plus 1.1" href="#">sign up<img src="http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png">
</a> and go conquer my demons back where it all started.” He finished the race, but the demons remained. “I went back to drinking because that was the only way I knew how to run,” he says.</p>
<p>Unable to cope through running alone, Alamo evaded his reality by watching sports and getting drunk. Perhaps by some twist of fate, his channel surfing landed on the IRONMAN World Championship broadcast one day in 2009. “The TV said ‘IRONMAN triathlon,” he recalls. “I had no idea what that was—I thought that Olympic distance triathlons were all that existed.” As age-groupers crossed the finish line, Alamo was inspired and immediately started looking for a race to do. He settled on, and completed, a local full-distance event, but the finish line still couldn’t slay the dragon. “Honestly, I thought that completing an IRONMAN race would fix me … (but) I was still a disaster inside.”</p>
<p>While some newly-minted IRONMAN finishers start planning their next events and new “personal bests” mere moments after completing their races, Alamo left his to get an 18-pack of beer and went home to drink. His life spiraled out of control as he found his “personal worst.” He drank heavily every day and got up to 300 lbs. In August 2011, he decided to end his life. (Alamo is pictured above in front of the bridge where he had planned to end his life.)<br>
Fate intervened a second time, and Alamo changed his mind. “I knew I had to find a better way,” he said. Recalling the same broadcast that inspired him, featured athlete Shane Niemeyer came to mind—”the journey from suicidal junkie to IRONMAN.”</p>
<p>“It was one of the first times in my life that I felt an emotion and didn’t reach for a beer. I knew then that I needed a purpose to stay occupied and find true sobriety.” Alamo decided to give an IRONMAN event another shot and, that fall, headed to Tempe, Arizona to volunteer and <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="background-color: transparent !important; border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background-position: initial initial !important; background-repeat: initial initial !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Cinema-Plus 1.1" href="#">register<img src="http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png">
</a> for 2012.<br>
This time, Alamo found a therapeutic experience. “I realized that IRONMAN racing could help me occupy my mind when all of the emotion, hurt and trauma from my past was in my face and I had to deal with it. It gave me a chance to heal while being active and sober.”</p>
<p>Though Alamo’s completed races have certainly helped him, it was actually a race he didn’t start that finally brought him peace. Alamo was among the athletes that arrived to race the 2014 <a href="http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman/lake-tahoe.aspx#axzz3LKbTudV6" target="_blank">IRONMAN Lake Tahoe</a> and was devastated when it was canceled just minutes before the start. “I trained so hard, and almost didn’t <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="background-color: transparent !important; border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background-position: initial initial !important; background-repeat: initial initial !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Cinema-Plus 1.1" href="#">sign up<img src="http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png">
</a> because I wasn’t sure I could finish such a tough course,” he recalls. “Although I was disappointed, I realized that it wasn’t doing the race that was going to define me or prove that I could be strong. It was the journey that got me there. In that moment, I knew that I had finally built the courage and strength to stand on my own two feet.”</p>
<p>Along with his experiences in triathlon, Alamo’s daughter is also a guiding light to him. “Whenever I experience lows in life, while training or at races, I always think of the way she’s supported and encouraged me through my disease over the years,” he says. “She reminds me that I have greatness inside, and to do an IRONMAN event for me and nobody else.”</p>
<p>Alamo may not “need” IRONMAN racing anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s ready to let it go. “I’ve met so many wonderful people in this sport, and one of my favorite things about it is having the opportunity to inspire others,” he says. Alamo discovered the IRONMAN Foundation when he was in Arizona, and knew he wanted to get involved. He’s headed back to Arizona next year and plans to raise $3,000 for the Foundation.</p>
<p>“I want to give back, and tell my story with the hope that I might help someone else.”<br>

<span class="s1">Eric Byrnes </span>played 11 years of Major League Baseball for Oakland, Arizona, and Seattle. His transition to triathlon wasn’t seamless – Eric couldn’t swim 25 yards when he first started in the sport and did his first tri on a beach cruiser.</p>
<p>But Byrnes, now an MLB Network analyst, persisted and finished IRONMAN Arizona in 2011 and 2013, IRONMAN US Championship in NYC and IRONMAN Lake Tahoe in 2013. Eric is a big supporter of The IRONMAN Foundation, Raising funds for the IMF, and also is a member of the IRONMAN Foundation Newton Running Ambassador Team. Eric has also raised tens of thousands of dollars in support of his friend Pat Tillman and the Pat Tillman Foundation. Eric Crosses the finish line of his IRONMAN events carrying Pat’s football jersey.<br>
Eric states that IRONMAN Arizona was “probably one of the most special things that I’ve ever done in my life”.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>For the past 6 years, The IRONMAN Foundation has provided over $60,000 in community fund grants to support swim lessons offered to all third graders in Kootenai County of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. The Foundation’s donations make the swimming program more accessible for students, as well as providing items such as towels and bathing suits to those that have no gear. Through these grants, students gain swimming skills, enjoy the sport and learn about the importance of water safety. The program has taught over 1,000 Kootenai County students water safety and swim basics. The most recent grant from the Foundation to the The Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Center helped increase enrollment by 50% and provided the needed funds to invite schools that had never been able to participate. As Idaho has the second highest childhood drowning rate in the nation, this program has the goal of saving children’s lives.</p>
